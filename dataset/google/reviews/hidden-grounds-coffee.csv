Jason Ganz, a month ago, 4, 'This place has excellent coffee. You get to pick the flavor of coffee you want for a pour over.  In addition, everything is done by cup, any not mass made in a bit machine, your cup therefore is fresh.  However, the bagel I got was overcooked, and was hard and chewy rather than soft.  If a bagel can be made soft but not insipid, that would be the perfect bagel to have with a morning cup of coffee.\n\nI am happy that it is a female owned business and will continue to support them. Just work on the bagels and the review will become five stars.'

Ashni D, 10 months ago, 1, 'I went to the Simply Chai in New Brunswick for the first time a couple of months ago (September 2020) and had a terrible experience. There was a male staff who was very rude to me and my family. The guy was unwelcoming, impatient, and spoke very aggressively to us when we were placing our order. We had some difficulty hearing him speak while he was wearing his mask and he got annoyed at us for having to repeat what he said. I have never experienced such terrible customer service at any other place. It made us feel very sad to be treated this way.\n\nWe ordered 4 hot chai drinks and they were all lukewarm and did not even taste like chai. It was lukewarm milk with some syrup in it. The small cups were only 3/4 full and for such an expensive place I would have expected at least a full cup of "authentic chai".\n\nI came back again last week hoping for a better experience, especially because I was a regular at Hidden Grounds. However, everything I mentioned above holds true - the same staff member was rude again and there was no improvement in the quality of the drinks, which is why I felt the need to write this review. I will not be coming back again.'

D Saxena, a year ago, 4, 'The food here is amazing. I‚Äôve been twice and had the cupcakes, donuts, veggie samosa, one of the chai drinks and kala Katta. All items were phenomenal. I don‚Äôt know what other reviewers are comparing the gulab jamun donut and ras malai cupcake to. I‚Äôve never had anything like these items, and regardless, the flavor is so strong on all items and comes through. The ras malai cupcake tastes like ras malai, the rose cupcake tastes like a rose falooda. Even the veggie samosa, though the frozen taste was there, it was still so nicely flavored that I didn‚Äôt care. Coming from downtown jersey city I know what bad cupcakes are and these are fluffy sweet and tasty. No they‚Äôre not magnolia or Carlos but we don‚Äôt need another vanilla cupcake. I will be back every chance I get. 4 stars is for the awful service. Please hire more and better people. It takes way too long for a basic order and the service is rude and unfriendly on top of it both times I have been. Sometimes slow service can be made up for by a warm smile and nice attitude, and this place doesn‚Äôt have it. But tone is set at the top so I would look for management to change this.'
Bri, a year ago, 4, 'I recently came here to try something different and enjoyed the drinks, though they are a bit on the pricier side. I love that they offer gluten free donuts, and had the lemon poppyseed. My boyfriend had a mango lassi and said the flavor was good, but would‚Äôve preferred it to be a bit colder (this could just be that we‚Äôre not used to how it should be prepared). I noticed a lot of reviews that had issues with the staff, but had a pleasant experience when we were there.'

Kelly Patel, a year ago, 2, 'Started following on Instagram and was really looking forward to my visit. I ordered a iced saffron chai tea latte which was disappointing. Only taste of milk and sugar came through. No saffron. I also ordered rose cupcake, ras malai cupcake, chai masala donut and gulab jamun donut. First of all the donuts where just cake mixes shaped in a round, not a donut, really dense and lacking in strong flavor. The cupcakes were GOD awful. Stale, unappetizing and the cream frosting was dense, rock hard, and tasted like thick cement. They need to do some quality control on their drinks and desserts. A place like this is an amazing concept and could do so much to advance strong Indian flavors but today‚Äôs selection was a miss. I wouldn‚Äôt go back unless they change. One star only for supporting a homegrown business and maintaining business during a pandemic.'
Aditi Gupta, a year ago, 1, "We ordered signature golaganda (crushed ice that costs more than $7 at this place after taxes) and all we got was rose flavored icy milk. This was supposed to have three flavors. Maybe they should tell people if they are out of 2 of the 3 flavors. I was so excited to try my favorite childhood dessert and was sorely disappointed. Who adds milk to gola?? Ridiculous.\n\nEdited to respond to the owner response: We were the only ones there when we ordered, and the server called us specifically to give this order to us on a table close to us (we didn't pick up the order from the counter). No one else came in or left during this time. Maybe you need to train your staff to prepare the correct order. We live 40 minutes away so can't just hop in again. Thanks for the response though."

Raj Asokkumar, a year ago, 1, 'To the Owner- Please teach some basic customer service to the person who is taking the order. I walked in to your place at 2:30PM- Aug 30th. The person taking the order said I may order the food through her or through the tablet. So we decided to order the food through the tablet. In the middle of the ordering process, the tablet timed out and deleted our cart before placing the order. So we walked up to her to place the order through her but she refused to take our order claiming that she was busy. When I went back to the tablet there was already someone placing the order and they took almost 10 mins to complete their order. When I asked her to bump our order because we were there before she refused and gave us a irresponsible reply to us. She simply said sorry with a horrible attitude but refuse to take out order. This place is really slow and if you are short of staff, hire an extra person. I saw 2 people walked out without placing the order  because this place is order. Please teach some basic customer service to your employees and tell them to apologize when they mean it or have a solution. You lost my business!'

There were two orders before me and the service was really slow. About 20-25 minutes after placing the order, they informed me that they stop preparing sandwiches 15 minutes before closing. I wish they informed me earlier or if there was a simple notice saying the same thing in the store then I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted 25 mins standing waiting for my order. The chai was disappointing for 5 bucks, which is more than Starbucks, and so was the Kala Khatta soda.\nI was there in early January as well when the menu had dosa waffles. The food was good back then but the service was slow and disappointing.\n\nEditing after owner‚Äôs response since there is no option for reply:\nAt least the staff should have a glance at the orders coming in and let people know they won‚Äôt be served food instead of making them wait for 20 mins before informing.\nWhy I called the chai disappointing?\nIt wasn‚Äôt good, I didn‚Äôt like it.

Still I see masala egg toast being launched a day ago and there\'s a point which I had stated before "We support vegan and vegetarian restaurants so still I cannot make it to your place " and believe me you have such an amazing Unique menu that I do not think and neither have read any review nor heard from anyone that your menu must have something non- vegetarian; then why?\n\nI really appreciate the the uniqueness of dosa waffles and had been a huge fan of bombay dreams and burning man. Go vegetarian and earn lifetime loyalty of customers like us.\n\nThanks!\n\nReply to owner‚Äôs message\n\nThere was one item called chicken noodle soup and other one with egg whose name I do not recall..\n\nAnd I am surprise you yourself do not know your restaurant is serving non-vegetarian dishesü§îüò≥üò≥\n\nUpdate after my visit to this place today\n\nI liked the place had been there last Friday and again today... Difference between in these visits was they have raised prices and started serving non-vegetarian meals. My friends had burning women waffle today n they did not like it all...\n\nWe support vegan and vegetarian restaurant so it\'s a good bye to this place.\n\nFirst review as under:\n\nWow what fusion food...burst of flavors...simply in love with Bombay Dreams waffle...would definitely suggest every Indian chaat and dosa lover to visit...I\'m not a chai lover but my friends loved their teas as well..'

But was totally dissappointed!!\nIt could have been or it still can be as the concept is really nice.\nThe ambience and interior decor is good though.'

I‚Äôve been craving some good chai for such a long time in nyc and so glad to have this place in my own neighborhood - Hoboken.\n\nFor those who want to get the authentic chai experience, try a chai flight which will get you to taste 3 different varieties of chai with Indian biscuits (cookies) that you can dunk in it.\n\nThe owners of this place also manage Hidden Grounds - an amazing local coffee shop in hoboken.\n\nThe savory waffles are a real treat as well. We‚Äôre pretty sure we‚Äôll be back here whenever we crave a Bombay sandwich'

Shireen Bhullar, 2 years ago, 4, "(In a nutshell - really good chai, great ambience, **burnt** dosa waffle at first but they replaced it upon complaint)\nA fairly new chai place in Hoboken with an amazing aesthetic and unique menu. Loved the entire decor with the ceiling umbrellas, their story on the side wall, and the faux grass wall in the back. What set them apart from other chai places is that they make chai fresh using the traditional stove method instead of brewing a larger quantity ahead of time. They have three main chais - masala, ginger and cardamom. We tried the ginger and the masala - they both tasted great. We asked for it to be stronger and bolder in taste and they were able to accommodate our preferences.\nThe only **negative** was our food (initially). We were really excited to try the dosa waffle - it is clearly an innovative concept. We realized they were busy and the food might take some time. After 25 minutes of wait, we were presented with a burnt dosa waffle (photos below for reference). We didn't even have to taste it, anyone could look at it and tell that it was burnt. So I took it back and asked for a new one - they were nice about it. They brought out our food in under 5 minutes and we appreciated it. I just hope in the future, they don't serve customers burnt food in the first place.\nAll in all - would recommend! :) Just expect a long wait on weekends."
Natasha, 2 years ago, 1, "It was my first time trying this place. I ordered masala  tea and it definitely didn't taste like masala tea. Taste was so bad almost seem like tea was reheated.  Tea was served in to go cup. Waiting time is very long more than 40 min."
Manpreet Mutti, 2 years ago, 1, "Majorly disappointed. Came here especially for the earthen pot. Horrible customer service. Long waiting hours for no reason. Place wasn't busy at all. When I got my tea served in a go to cup I was given the explanation that the place is closing for the night soon and we are putting those pots in the dishwasher. Why wasn't I made aware of this 30 mins ago when I had made the order. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Place is only Instagram glam without the actual substance behind it. Wish I could give zero for this review"

Priyank Thakor, 2 years ago, 4, 'Good tea.  The dosa dishes are good concept but a little heavy on chutney.'
SIDDHARTH BHANSALI, 2 years ago, 5, "Amazing place to spend time alone or with friends....Masala Chai served with 2 little hearts must have - bit overpriced but worth if you are Chai lover....Bombay dream dosaüòãüòã - reminded me of Mumbai grilled sandwich in a dosa.\nGuilty pleasure had chocolate syrup - could have been better with Nutella but overall can't give less than 5 *."

K A, 2 years ago, 2, 'Initially this place served a great tea, now it looks like they are just reheating the old tea and the place has become little  unhygienic. Tea khullad are chipped from top edge, place have weird smell especially at the tables near restroom and tables do get clean often. Out of three visits only my first visit was great. Sometime they serve tea on table sometime they just call out for pick up. Not going back there!!'

Sarat Chandra, 2 years ago, 5, "A cute chai based cafe serving good drinks and food with fabulous Indian themed decor.\n\nDetailed Review:\nAbsolutely loved the Indian themed decor which gives it a hip modern cafe feel. The food and drinks served here were great and it is slightly expensive for drinks but the dosas are reasonably priced. The ambience was great, would definitely recommend the sofa seats with cushions to sit and work a few hours or spend a leisurely afternoon here.\n\nDuring my visit, I had tried their Rose thandaai with Bombay dreams dosa. The rose thandaai was a gently flavored rose drink which was light, delicious and very pleasant to have. It wasn't overwhelmed by sweetness or rose essence and had good balance. The Bombay dreams waffle dosa was great, it packed a punch of flavors with the green mint and date chutneys. The Bombay dreams waffle dosa was a fusion of the classic Bombay sandwich and the savory waffles. FYI, few may find the savory dosas like the Bombay Dreams pretty spicy and be mindful. The portion sizes were great and service was just fab.\n\nBtw, they serve Little Hearts biscuits with Chai. FYI, Little Hearts is one of the most iconic Indian heart shaped biscuits/snacks from the 90s and is still pretty popular.\n\nRecommendations:\nDrinks: Magic Masala Chai (hot), Rose Thandaai (cold)\nSavory Dosas: Bombay Dreams or Burning Man"

Andrew G, 2 years ago, 5, 'A great addition to the Hidden Grounds empire in a warm and spacious space inherited from Sunnyside Cafe (even the neon sign remains!). Selling dosas as waffles (that is, waffles using dosa batter) is pretty inspired and the result is delicious. I like the simplest one personally ("Mom\'s Favorite"). The chai is very good and unlike in South Asia you don\'t have to worry about an upset stomach :-) .'

Karina Colotl, 2 years ago, 4, 'The rose chai was absolutely amazing. I would totally recommend it and go back here for it. The dosa waffle however was not very good. It was on the harder side and had a strange after taste (personal preference).'

Barbara Lopez, 2 years ago, 4, 'Really cute restaurant, instagram worthy. I had a traditional chai latte hot, it was good, full of spices. I also tried the dosa waffles, which were interesting. They had small cookies with some types of chai which were delicious. Staff was very friendly.'
