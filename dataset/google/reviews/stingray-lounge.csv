Specifically pointed out the table i was waiting for, and he said okay just give it a couple of mins until they leave and the table is yours. After 20 mins the people left and as we were about to sit the waiter comes up and says the table is reserved. Very unpleasant experience before we even got to sit.'

tiffany Jones, 3 months ago, 3, 'Great happy hour until 6. Half off sparkling wine and oysters. Great selection of oysters. The food was ok. Not very seasoned. I was not impressed with seating. I made reservations as soon as the restaurant opened. We were sat in probably the worst seat (outdoors and table was on a slant) I informed staff and asked to change tables to one of the other outside tables, since no one was there and we were the only ones outside. Staff informed us that they could not accommodate us because of other reservations. However the other reservations were not there and how would they know which table they have? Do people reserve specific tables ? I was annoyed and was not pleased with how this minor situation was handled.'
Andy Finneran, 3 months ago, 5, "Best oysters and raw bar in Hoboken! Cocktails are great as are the appetizers and entrees. People kept telling me their burger was phenomenal but I was always in the mood for their other entrees. Turns out the Burger is awesome too! Don't forget Happy Hour.."

Kay Ulanday Barrett, 4 months ago, 4, "Stingray lounge is a lovely light snack and dinner option if you want to treat yourself to lavish. The service was quick and helpful. The afternoon was quiet for 4pm and we chose indoor seating since the hit heat outdoors was distracting at the patio. We had a dozen of oysters at oyster happy hour and the most memorable were light and creamy like the sugar shack and the beau soleil. They were out of Kumamoto unfortunately.  We also went with brinier wellfleets!\n\nFor main meal we ordered a crab Cobb that was a good portion with chunks of crab and bacon which made a stunning combo with the crisp vegetables. The lobster Mac was deceptive. It looked small in a bowl but as you ate, you realized that it was dense and rich and buttery. We went home with leftovers! Overall a great and yes, an expensive experience. The restaurant was clean and followed covid protocols but the hand sanitizer was super scented like perfume, that's my only gripe! A lovely hip date in Hoboken with outdoor options. Definitely recommend."

AB, 6 months ago, 1, 'A major disappointment to say the least. I used to bartend for a long time and you‚Äôd think a place like this could at least do a dirty martini right... drinks did not taste that great (other than one); felt like my martini had soap and water in it tbh. We came here later at night and got the vibe we should hurry up and leave, reminded a few times they were wrapping up (we were on a wait list before, tried to go earlier). I know how it is, tired and wanting to head home after a long day, but please consider this isn‚Äôt about YOU, it‚Äôs a customer experience.\n\nWe ordered the boil for 2...barely any crab, a bunch of potatoes and sausage with a decent amount of shrimp in a watery broth with spice sprinkled in. This is a beautiful spot with nice decor, and I think the idea of it is nice, but I‚Äôd rather walk down Washington for good food/drinks, than the 2ft it takes me from my apartment to here. Our waiter was amenable to requests & I appreciate that.'

Angela Cruz, 6 months ago, 4, "Second visit two Saturdays ago. Service, wine, cocktails and most dishes are excellent. However, I must say that this time, we were disappointed and very annoyed that their kumamoto oysters were extremely tiny... you pay a little over $4 each for an oyster smaller than the size of a quarter. They were good but it was even difficult to enjoy the taste because they were so tiny. They were definitely the smallest kumamoto oysters that I've ever been served or that I've ever seen. Other than that, no complaints. I must say the ambiance is also very pleasant."

Blue point was the in between of meat and sea flavor. Slurpalicious!\n\nCrab cakes were lovely as well as the clams oregenata.  One can't go wrong with the seafood here!  They have their signature hot sauce, but it was hard to pour out!  It wasn't spicy to me, but I only had a few drops out, if that was the case.\n\nService was attentive and it was warm and cozy here (probably because it was non peak hours)."

Melanie Tam, 4 years ago, 4, "Stingray Lounge is a hidden gem. I was really hesitating to write this review because I'm being selfish and don't want anyone else to know about this place. It's has four of my favorite things about a bar:\n\n1. Cheap drinks\n2. Seating\n3. Discounted apps (in this case, 50 cent clams on Thursdays)\n4. Late HH (Sun-Thurs 5-10: 50% off draft beers on Thursdays)\n\nMy boyfriend and I came in on a Thursday at around 7:30 and there were still a few seats left at the bar. Stingray Lounge is small. There are probably about 10 bar seats, and a couple of small tables in the back. It's definitely not for large groups but is a great date night spot.\n\nThe clams are such a great deal! They're comparable to NYC's HH $1 clams. They were plump and fresh tasting. On this night, I discovered that I might be allergic to either horseradish or mignonette, or at least an ingredient in there. Usually, when I eat it with clams, my throat gets super itchy. However, Stingray's clams comes with neither of these - just lemon and cocktail sauce, and these clams were fine for me. We also ordered some Old Bay fries on the side and it came with this great (homemade?) mustard dipping sauce.\n\nMy only peeve was that it took a bit longer to get their attention for another drink/the check, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. It's not like we were in a rush, anyway.\n\nLooking forward to some more of those clams!"
