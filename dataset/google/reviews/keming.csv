Ari Jiang, 2 weeks ago, 3, 'We just moved to Hoboken and saw this place has hotpot so decided to try it. Do NOT recommend. I can make much better hotpot at home that’ll cost less. The hotpot we had there was pathetic. Ugh. What they make is so amateur and is overpriced for what it is. If you want authentic hotpot go to Manhattan, LIC or best - flushing. If you don’t wanna travel, do yourself a favor and go to h mart and just buy ingredients there.\n\nOnly reason not giving a lower star is that the younger waiter was very considerate and caring. We really appreciate his service - hope you find a better place to work.\n\nWe’ll try this place’s regular dishes and revise review if needed.'

Katrina Cheung, a month ago, 5, 'Some of the best Chinese food I’ve ever had and it takes a lot for me to say that as a Chinese person. Love their beef and broccoli, the chicken fried rice and their chicken wings. Everything is always so good and it doesn’t make you feel bleh afterwards which is great.'
Michael Quinlan, a month ago, 5, "Excellent food, great service.  My only regret is that I ordered pork fried rice thinking I was specifying the type of rice that went with my lunch special, when what I actually received was a meal-sized portion in addition to my meal.  It was delicious nonetheless!  I'd go back again soon if it weren't for all the other places in Hoboken I have yet to try."

I tried almost everything on the menu and still not disappointed. It's BYOB. Very convenient location being that a liquor store is next door. My husband is very picky with food and he can't stop talking about how delicious the food is. Number one Chinese dining in Hoboken. Oh, and if you like spicy,  they'll recommend a really good dish! I recommend the cucumber appetizer to calm down the spice if you dare to go spicy!"

Karen N, a year ago, 1, 'Isn’t it illegal to charge prices that aren’t on the menu in the restaurant or online? This has happened twice. We’ve ordered take out and have been told, “oh, this is not $11, it’s actually $15 now but none of our menus have been updated”. Greasy food that comes at a high cost. You’re better off dining at Precious closer to the PATH station than at Keming. Disappointing. Also, there’s no way you can hydrate enough after all the MSG that is put into the food - not great on your health or your wallet.'

Aja Koenig, a year ago, 4, "Since the beginning of quarantine, our normal go-to Chinese restaurant has been shut down. I had heard great things about Keming and we finally tried it. It was GREAT! The order arrived on time and was nice and hot! Here is my review on each item we ordered:\n\nString Beans w/min Pork- DELICIOUS!!!!\nSpicy Dan Dan Noodles - Amazing! I haven't had these anywhere else, so I don't have anything to compare them to, but I loved them! I am always looking for spicy noodle dishes and they are hard to find at most places in Hoboken. These hit the spot and the spice level was on point!\nBeef Lo Mein - My husband enjoyed it. I tasted it and it was on par with other places. Also, not one of my favorite dishes in general so I don't care. As long as he liked it, we are good to go.\nEgg Rolls- Decent, not amazing. More like Spring Rolls, which I love, but basic here.\nBeef Dumplings - AMAZING! I love the thickness of the dumpling and the beef had great flavor.\nWonton in Spicy Sauce- OK. The meat inside was mediocre, but the spicy sauce was delicious.\nWonton Soup- Disappointing. Very bland.\n\nWe went a little crazy on how much we ordered because we wanted to try a lot of different things. Can't wait to order again and try more! I recommend trying Keming if you have not done so.  Great find!"

All the veggie dishes we've had have been great, particularly the eggplant and home style string beans. It's a great place to branch out from your usual Chinese food order."
Poohlein Rampen, 3 years ago, 5, "I've only done takeout, and all the dishes so far were great. Had the string beans with pork, shredded beef with spicy pepper, and dry sauteed cabbage.

There are some dishes that were new to me but I have enjoyed everything that I've tried, some things more than others. In particular have enjoyed the fish and tofu dishes, as well as standards like dumplings. My kids love the sesame chicken and here it's actually good. Staff is very friendly.

I would say Keming is a good option if you want Chinese, but don't want takeout. It seems pretty authentic for the area. Plus they have a Szechuan hot pot, which I'll be back to try!\n\nTip - BYOB!
