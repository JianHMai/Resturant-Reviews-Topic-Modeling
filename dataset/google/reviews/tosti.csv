Immanuel Gregory, 4 months ago, 3, 'Quite the experience, though a little unorganized.\n-\nSpending some time in NJ, we decided to hit up Tosti which seems to be a Breakfast/Lunch hybrid restaurant. I\'d like to talk about the service more than anything. The servers are a mixed bag of fun; some are very lively and others are very polite. I could only spot a couple of long faces which is understandable, they get a good bit of service so a smile isn\'t always affordable.\nI couldn\'t catch the names of them but I want there was a asian lady dressed in red who was great at making the environment feel particularly welcome, many thanks to you.. whoever you are.\n\nAn odd situation that keeps the rating lower is that they not only forgot an order, but were unable to split a check. I won\'t fault them for it though, but it seems like "splitting the check" isn\'t a common concept - if it is.. I have no clue why it caused so much confusion.\n\nThe food was really good, I especially enjoyed their French Fries and Tosti Burger\nI recommend this spot, just the service was spotty.'

Kaitlyn Short, 2 years ago, 1, 'If I could give this 0 stars I would.\n\nLast week I went to tosti I ordered the farmers breakfast. The "biscuits" were more of a very dry roll and the gravy was like water. I am very picky about biscuits so I thought I just ordered the wrong thing because everything in all the pictures looks so good, right?!\n\nToday I went back. I ordered a Belgian waffle and the person I was with ordered French toast (both side items). My water had a dead gnat in it and was warm because they just have glasses of water sitting in the corner to give you when you come in. We then proceeded to wait for 30 minutes ..... for a piece of toast and a waffle. Now, I was a server for years and I understand the struggles. However, our server never came to us to let us know what was going on. The tables to both sides of us got there after us, ate, paid and left and we were still waiting. I get up to ask someone and they said they would have it right out. Great! I sat back down and waited. 50 minutes later... still no food or server. I went to the counter and told them I would like to pay for my drink and just leave. They did not allow me to do that. Instead they brought an appetizer of fries to my table..... then a man (who I assume is the manager) comes over and told me they were having issues with the waffle maker... yet multiple people around me had been getting waffles.... then our server came up to us and said the kitchen was behind... also a lie because people who came after us had gotten their food and left. Our server finally brought out the food and it was not at all hot and the waffle was so bland. I mean, when continental breakfast at a hotel has a better waffle then your restaurant you should probably just take it off the menu. this place had plenty of chances to make this right, but did not. I\'m always very patient and understanding in restaurants because I know what it\'s like to be a server, but I was absolutely livid. We got our bill and we had been charged for every item... you would think they would at least have taken something off for our wait... wouldn\'t you? This place is horribly managed. This is not how you treat customers. This place will not last here.'

The staff was welcoming and polite, 5 stars for customer service. As I waited for my order I took some pics of the quaint, classy, yet cozy atmosphere. The food is very, very, very, very delicious. It was fresh, satisfying, eye pleasing and most importantly flavorful yet not overdone my sliders came with a well made raspberry jam. I tried the avocado toast and it was soooo soooo good. The french toast was good as well yet for my taste a little on the dry side, it was served beautifully with fresh cut strawberries.
