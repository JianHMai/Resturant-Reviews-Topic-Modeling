Natalie Charle Ellis, a week ago, 4, 'We had a beautiful date night! The wine was delicious and the artichoke appetizer as well as the pasta. I will say we got the short rib and wasn’t my favorite and a pretty fatty cut of meat. So next time I will stick to their pasta because you can tell it is handmade with delicious sauces and the scallops were cooked perfectly. We will be back!'

Janelle Hoffman, a month ago, 5, 'Grand Vin hosted us for our engagement party, and it was honestly one of the best days of our lives! I highly, highly recommend them if you are looking to host a shower or any kind of celebration!\n\nTo start, this restaurant is our happy place. We come here about once a week ether to have dinner or enjoy a drink at the bar. So, when we were considering having an engagement party, we knew it would have to be at Grand Vin.\n\nDecor reminds me of Napa, like a slightly rustic (but also super classy) wine bar. You don’t even need much decor because the string lights and greenery throughout the restaurant set the perfect, romantic vibe.\n\nThe service is top-notch, Amanda and Mike (the managers) were communicative and so helpful organizing everything. I was able to drop off decor the day prior and then leave everything fully in their hands to execute. We spent about the first 45 mins or so of the party hanging out in the bar area with passed appetizers, then were all seated in the dining room for the meal. They timed all of the courses perfectly and the portions were incredibly generous!\n\nThe food is insanely good; everyone kept talking about it. I dream of that sea bass and gnocchi all the time!\n\nWe had about 45 people seated in their back dining area, but they can fit a bit more than that if you rent out the whole space. There is also a parking garage about a block away (a SUPER huge plus for all Hoboken venues!).'

ScodaWithLime, 2 months ago, 5, "The atmosphere is lovely. We sat outside and the seating with string lights and dividers from the street made for a nice atmosphere. We had a table of 7 (for a birthday dinner) and ordered a few different apps for split. Stuffed shrimp, buratta, calamari and tacos all delicious. I had the chicken dish which was huge and just so amazing. My boyfriend had the pork chop and said not one part was dried out. A few others had the gnocchi and it was also delicious. Everyone loved their food and the prices aren't terrible considering the quality you get. I would definitely recommend and I plan to return."
Kristina Matyushchenko, 2 months ago, 3, 'Food is ok but VERY SLOW service. You literally have to wait for your order an hour and a half and remind the servers 50 times to bring stuff you asked for... I don’t think we are eating here again.'
Ariel Casciano, 2 months ago, 5, ''
Elizabeth Wasserman, 2 months ago, 4, "Food here is really good. Service was not great when I went. Our server sat down with a customer at a table for some time while we were eating. I'm not usually annoying about service because I understand but sitting at the table across from us with a customer while we don't have water is not a great look. Additionally, we ordered a dish that said it came with shrimp on the menu but it arrived with scallops which I don't love and don't usually order. I didn't want to send it back so I just alerted the server their menu was incorrect and he didn't believe me until I pulled up the QR code menu and showed him. He comped the dish-thank you.\n\nThe main entree I got was chillean sea bass with spinach, it was delish. Also the mussels marinara were really good! I do recommend I think it was just an off day. Will return."

I ordered the rigatoni vodka and he ordered the four cheese ravioli. The only reason I’m not making it 5 stars is because I told 2 waiters to bring a dessert with a candle on it for my boyfriend’s birthday and they didn’t. Overall, I loved the food and ambiance.'

Plus they made the tip included but didn't tell us. Just gave us a receipt with a tip line so I double tipped them and they said nothing.  Was trying to support local businesses but wasn't expecting to get scammed. Never going there again.  Now I hope they go out of buisness.  Not how you treat your customers."
