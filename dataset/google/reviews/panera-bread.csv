Ordered delivery, order was missing two items from the bakery, two beverages, and one side...literally missing 5/7 items in the order. Tried to call and nobody answered so I left to walk to the store to get the items. I assumed nobody was answering because they were swamped, nope, walked into the store and there are barely and costumers. Told them what I was missing, they asked me to repeat it 3 times, barely gave an apology, and then gave me a bag full of what was missing. Get back to my apartment only to find out that that they didn’t put one of the two missing baked goods in the bag. Partially my fault for not checking since apparently their combined IQ couldn’t provide enough power to lightly toast a slice of bread.'

Kyle Weber, 2 years ago, 4, 'I wanted to dislike this place — mainly because I am annoyed by any fast casual restaurant that charges the prices of a restaurant with waiter service — but it nevertheless won me over.  The Mac and Cheese is enjoyable if a bit staid, the chips end up being a cut above Lay’s and Pringle’s, and the kitchen sink cookie was reminiscent of Momofuku Milk Bar’s Compost cookie (in other words, really really good but also sold at a premium price).  None of this is world-changing and the prices are higher than I would like for a chain with no waiter service and a limited cafe menu, but the environment is comfortable enough and the food tasty enough to make this place comfortable in its own way.   A few more visits like my last one here and I’ll call myself a fan of the chain.'

Also, patrons tend to leave their used plates at their seats even after they leave, so sometimes you'll have to bus your own tables.

Leon Cal, 3 years ago, 2, 'I usually get coffee here which was good. Today I decided to get their chicken soup and went with a bowl wanting obviously eat more lol.\nSo it was a bowl and a small coffee that I ordered. However the cashier charged me for a soda instead of a small coffee which she then gave me a large cup of coffee to make up for the minor error which is fine.\n\nI got my food order ringer and waited by my table to get my food delivered nearly 15 Minutes later I went to check in and nothing still. They seemed a little busy so I didn’t make much of it however 5 minutes later still nothing and eventually I saw them put what looked like chicken noodle soup on the counter, idk if it was mine but I asked and I took it and boy was that soup serving really really small for a “bowl” serving.\n\nBut then again I barely order Panera food and I guess small servings is there thing ? Anyways I’ll still come back but just to get coffee. Other than this minor experience it’s still a good place to chill and read.'

Paz de Jesus, 3 years ago, 3, "I love Paneras but it has become too pricey. No longer a healthy alternative for the budget conscience.\nI saw a couple people buy Mc Donalds food and come into Panera to sit. I think that's rude but it's just too expensive."

I cannot really comment on the quality of the service to folks who choose to use the registers, as I regularly use the mobile or online ordering, but my orders are usually ready at my requested times and fresh enough to eat right away.  If you live or work in the downtown part of Hoboken, this is usually a good choice for a cup of coffee or quick bite to eat.'

I ordered a sweet onion and cheese steak sandwich with a cheese and broccoli soup with the bread and all . There is a big difference in quality when eating here and fast food restaurant . I choose Panera Bread ! and when I signed up for a Panera Bread reward card , I got a free ( pastry) sweet ! It was starting to get a little busy when I was leaving. Saturday or Sunday afternoon around 3 pm. Great location ~ 5 stars ~'

Week after week, their food quality, service, preparation time and cleanliness is keep going down.\n\nI do not know what is wrong with this location?!

This location is pretty active, and as such the atmosphere is a bit one of nervous energy.  I guess I just prefer a quieter, more sedate coffee shop.

Nick Lenzi, 3 years ago, 2, "This is one of the few spots in Hoboken where you can have a meeting or study.

They also have a few good soups. I like their french onion when they have it.\n\nThe problem though is the management of this place. There's no order in the establishment. There seems to be people who are in there the entire day and they hog the outlets. Doesn't even matter if you get there at 6am when they open they'll still be there taking up all the outlets.\n\nIt can also get very loud in this place so bring a pair of good headphones with you."
