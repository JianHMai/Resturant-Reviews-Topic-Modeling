Tay-Tay N, 3 weeks ago, 1, "The Food was disgusting. I ordered the steak salad and my boyfriend had the rosemary roasted chicken. When I tell you the worst meal we've had in years, I recommend no one eat here. My steak was cold and looked raw. Way Too chewy and the greens looked days old. My boyfriend's chicken was pink and his string beans were soggy. He couldn't even eat the rice because the grains were stuck together and cold. One star, hope I don't die of food poisoning."

Mica Nkusi, 2 months ago, 2, "*Delivery order review*\n\nTried this restaurant a number of times over the last 3-4 years and early on i was happy with the quality of the food. But in the last year that's changed dramatically.\n\nMy last order of the herb marinated steak is a prime example of how bad its become. The steak which used to be medium is more over cooked & dry, the sweet potatoes which are supposed to be cubed and roasted came mushy and burnt ( not first time) and the sauted broccoli had an acrid taste.\n\nQuality level here has been consistently dropping over my last 3 orders so clearly not an isolated instance. Truly hope they improve but can't recommend at this point"

Brian G, 5 months ago, 4, "It's difficult for me to give 5 stars to fast casual restaurants. Though the staff is nice, the interaction is merely transactional of a assembly line nature. The 4 stars is strictly food based, which was hearty and delicious. Every year my father and I plant a garden with an assortment of vegetables. Both parents grew up in N.C. so farm to table was a way of life. I have a bias against a restaurant on the strip of Hoboken saying they are fresh/nutritious. However, a man's gotta eat."

I called to let them know and its been 30mins for them to deliver when I am only down the block (Im super pregnant and its 88 degrees outside which is why i'm not walking back) . The salad is not worth it - they provided me with a tiny side of dressing ON THE SIDE. Never ordering from here again."

Also, the portion sizes seem to vary a bit. I\'ve gotten different amounts of chicken in the bowl each time. All in all though a good choice for healthy food. Plus their "simple kale caesar" is the best I\'ve ever had and I don\'t even like kale that much!'

Richard England, 7 months ago, 1, "So I just ordered a Chef's Plate with a base of brown rice, sides of carrots & broccoli, with salmon as my protein.  When handed the bowl, it looked as if somebody had eaten half of it.  This had to be the skimpiest $15 meal ever sold.  I get it if it were just the small piece of protein as I've had that happen before, but this server went incredibly light on the rice & sides too....the RICE!!!\nI usually don't do this bc my opinion isn't overly important, but I needed to vent. The silver lining is that it eliminated a choice of establishments in hoboken that I'll frequent."

The staff was busy but were able to keep up and keep the place clean and in order.  My only issue and why I rated a 3 was the music that was playing. I know I’m an older gentlemen but I can’t imagine why a restaurant that serves patrons of all ages, races and ethnic groups would  allow vulgar music to play so loud you can’t hear the person standing next to you.  I mean this is a place to grab a bite to eat not a night club.  I hope they make different choices in the future and maybe this was a one off situation because the food is great.'

Imyourkings King, 3 years ago, 1, 'So I go to this place about 4 to 5 times a week, I work in jersey but live in nyc,  but sometimes even when I’m off I drive to Hoboken just to get the salmon from this place, so early today I went and there were about 3 to 4 employees at the counter, one of the employees even asked me if I’m there for the salmon again, that’s how often I go there. I said yes and she turned around cleaning and doing whatever she was doing, by soon as the white girl came, ole girl jumped took her gloves off put new ones on and asked the girl if she needed help, I was very mad and felt some type of way, I brought it to Sheryl’s attention who wa stage manager on duty, she apologized and offer me free cup of lemonade, I always get extra meat with my food and it comes out to over 20 dollars, as expensive as that meal is, I’m expecting an outstanding customer service, and not only that I always leave a 5 dollar tip. But never going again and I’ll tell my friends to stop going cause we do not tolerate racism and definitely only take our money where we are respected and welcomed.'

T. Pisani, 3 years ago, 3, "Edit: they recently started weighing out their portions of meat which always results in getting less than you used to as you used to just get a full chicken breast but now they always take away some after they cut it up. Really not happy about that. the place is already expensive but at least I used to get a full piece of chicken\n\nI really like this place. Great option for healthy food that actually tastes good. A little pricey for my liking but the food is too good to let that stop me. One weird complaint though.. every single time i go there i have to swat flies away from my meal. I don't get why they always have them even in winter but it's annoying and gross."
Brett Hladczuk, 3 years ago, 5, "Are you sick of Chipotle? I have good news for you: there's another white girl heaven, and it's right next door in Quality Greens. This is my favorite healthy place on Washington. The portions are big, food is delicious, service is quality."

Maggie Nelson, 3 years ago, 2, 'Placed an order right when they opened at exactly 11am. Depsite this, it took 1.5 hrs to arrive. Was trying to make a flight, so I called a couple times and was promised that it was “almost to the house” which clearly was not the case. Food isn’t bad, but customer service and efficiency is certainly lacking and will make or break a restaurant in Hoboken.'

Christian Herraiz, 3 years ago, 2, "Quality greens used to have amazing food but for the last 2 months have been subpar. I've gone there to get dinner three times in the last 2 months and each time the chicken is under cooked and pink. The Mac and cheese served was also reheated and hard this last time. I pick up dinner at 6/7 pm so the food shouldn't be old by then."
