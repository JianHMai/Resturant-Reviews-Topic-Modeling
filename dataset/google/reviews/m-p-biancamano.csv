David Montanez, 5 months ago, 1, 'Today I had the worse experience at Biancamano. The sandwich and customer service were terrible. The sandwich was dry and so was the customer service from Pete\'s wife. The sandwich was like a paver block and almost broke my teeth. The mayo was like spackle and the mozz was as dry as a desert. When I called to complain, Pete\'s wife wanted to entire sandwich back at the store as if she was going to resell with my 2 bite marks. I told her I paid good money for the sandwich and she said, "You think $9.00 is a lot of money?" The only reason I have 1 star is because it wont let me post the comment without a star. Its a shame it came down to this after years of being a good customer. Thank you M&P for the terrible experience. The good thing is that I will never have to experience this again. Goodbye M&P!!'

The place itself is not fancy at all, a few chairs inside actually with a family style decor. But you don't come.here for the decor, you come here for the mozarella.

My boyfriend and I shared it as we were both stuffed!\n\nMy only gripe was the bread. It was super chewy. I'm not sure if it was because I went midday and I got the second to last piece of bread. But I'm willing to go earlier next time and give it another try. Their mozzarella is just too good to pass up."
