Mr. Joanna Dark, a week ago, 5, "I ordered 4 boxes of  Pizza for my daughter's birthday the night before, hoping this would eliminate the problem of my food getting on time. My Pizza arrived an hour later than expected. They didn't even call me as a courtesy to inform me that my delivery would be late. When I called, I was told it should be there as we spoke and the driver still didn't arrive. When I finally got the Pizza, the pies looked burnt/recooked. I will not recommend this place for delivery and terrible customer service. I should have ordered from another place. Avoid ordering from them; you might as well starve, and it seems you pay for old Pizza. I wish they had negative stars as rating."

The Critical J, 2 months ago, 5, "PROS: This pizza place is the best parlor overall in the area. Unlike the other pizza parlors this place is big, clean, and has room to sit down. They accept credit cards for any size purchase and the employees are nice. It's located where many of the bars are and they offer a variety of toppings just like any parlor would\n\nCONS: The tables can only hold 3 people max. so if you have a group of 5+ then you're out of luck on grabbing a place to sit\n\nOVERALL: I will be coming back here. This place is the best around, so why would I settle for less?"

Just a heads up for a quick fix - on Seamless, you have the ability to pick your toppings per half (left and right side) but I don‚Äôt think that is translating to the order that the chef sees. Tonight we had like 6 toppings over the whole pizza but we were trying to make a meat side and veggie side, so I ended up not being able to eat it. If you can fix that, we will definitely order again! Thank you!'

I love a family business :)  I can't recommend Imposto's enough, any time a friend or client is new to visiting Hoboken, I take them to Imposto's for the best WORLD FAMOUS pizza.

Carly Porreca, 3 years ago, 5, 'Do not ever go to this place. I came here to get a slice of pizza and accidentally left my phone on the counter while ordering (typical mistake). I noticed didn‚Äôt have it as soon as i sat down to eat and asked the staff if they found a phone and they said no the multiple times we asked.  My friend had my location tracked and it said that I.T was in the pizza place for the whole two hours we were here. We checked the entire place up and down and had every customer in there searching with us. We accused the workers multiple times of taking  I.T and they kept denying saying they were not ‚Äúthose type of people.‚Äù As soon as i threatened to call the cops, they said that they were going to check the bathroom. They came back from the bathRoom with the phone soaking wet in toilet water claiming that i had dropped I.T in the toilet. However, i did not go to the bathroom once the whole time i was there. Not to mention, i had multiple people calling and tRacking my phone within these two hours and I.T was ringing and trackable so If I.T had been in there the whole time I.T would not have been responsive. These workers planted my phone inside of the toilet so that the police wouldn‚Äôt come and search them. They are thieves and criminals. Do not give this place any business.'

Nice crunchy crust. The people working in there were extremely helpful and friendly. If I lived near I would definitely stop by!!!!'

steven harris, 4 years ago, 5, 'Imposto‚Äôs got 1 star for delivery only....They over cooked my calzone and stuffed it with pepperoni so nasty barely any cheese. I ordered cheese fries and they put 2 pieces of cheese on top and microwaved the cheese smdh so nasty. I wasted my money and my chocolate cake was nasty tasted like it was from a old vending machine...never again I would rather starve'
Carsten Hansen, 4 years ago, 5, 'In my humble opinion, this is the best pizza place in Hoboken and there are several. It has been around as far back as I have come to Hoboken, the food is great, not just the pizzas. Their sandwiches are large, their servings generous, the food is cooked fresh and is very tasty. The interior is unassuming but more than sufficient if you come for a quick bite to eat.'

Kay Kay, 4 years ago, 5, "First and last time ordering they over charge for the food. Bake ziti was extremely dry basically just noodles and cheese. Chicken was overcooked and dry bc of it being overcooked. The Pizza was flat and slid in the box. The rolls were just thrown in the bag on top of the food not in a boso or anything just thrown in the bag wit the ziti and chicken. Never again will I order a meal from them. The total was 37.87 and the guy answering the phone is rude. Now after waiting 45 min on them to deliver I'm  waiting on them to one get this dry a as food."
