Nicole, 3 months ago, 2, 'My boyfriend and I have come here many times. We enjoy the food, drinks and the ambiance outside. However, our last visit wasn\'t so enjoyable. We made a reservation for 4, my boyfriend, myself and his grandparents for outside. As we arrived, we realized there were no seats outside that were available. My boyfriend spoke to the hostess (or she may have been the manager, I\'m not sure) who let us know our table was taken by a random group of people who just decided to sit down there. We were disappointed by this, especially due to her rude and dismissive attitude. I went inside and spoke to her, she told me "we don\'t do reservations outside" when we requested this over the phone. I asked politely if there was any way we could possibly still sit outside as there was a party of 2 sitting at a 4 person table and there was an open 2 person table. She responded "I\'m not going to tell them to move." We decided to sit inside only to see that there were only high-top tables. Normally we wouldn\'t care but my boyfriend\'s grandparents are older and these weren\'t the most convenient for them. I kindly again asked the hostess if there\'s anything she can do to accommodate. She let us know there was a party in the back (which I understood) but made it clear she wouldn\'t help us so at that point I just gave up.\nThe food was good and our server was nice but other than that, the interaction we had with her was unpleasant and ruined this place for us. Don\'t think we\'ll be returning.'

Came with a friend on a Saturday night and we ordered food and a decent amount of drinks (not sure how much more we could have ordered) and we were rudely rushed out. I even mentioned that a stool was broken and was given an attitude. Not the right way to treat customers who are more than willing to spend. I didnt appreciate the attitude from the staff here and don‚Äôt think I will be returning unfortunately.'

Diana Ruggiero, 9 months ago, 1, "The manage had terrible manners and was really unprofessional!!! I usually go here often but since the pandemic, I haven't been out as much. Last night my friend and I decided to go out and try to enjoy ourselves. When the manager was looking at us weird the whole night. It truly made me feel very uncomfortable. My friend was standing next to me since people were standing up socializing real closely and she rushed over followed by a rude comment she made. I didn't appreciate it at all. Sad to say I won't be coming back until they have a new manager that's not rude or unprofessional. When someone is paying money to dine out they want a more pleasant experience. However she acted like trash."

Xauen Zirpolo, a year ago, 5, "A real gem in Hoboken. Most places that offer brunch have either an expensive prefix or a small selection; the Stewed Cow is a lovely exception. $25 gets you their brunch prefix with two drinks and a choice of entree; I got the Frankie's feast and it was delicious. Drinks are nicely sized and very tasty- the bloody mary was especially good, just the right amount of everything. I always try and make a reservation on Open Table since they have limited outdoor seating. They're also very dog-friendly if you choose to bring your pet with you and sit outside."
Michael Tukhugov, a year ago, 4, 'Delicious food!!! Even if you go here just for the wings it will be worth it but get a churro while you are there. Great drink specials, definitely try the season fall craft drinks, the apple cider is wonderful. Carissa the manager made sure to introduce herself & check on us which is nice you dont see managers do that much anymore, great service, clean bathrooms! I would have given 5 stars but the stools are just terrible, get a seat if you can or sit along the bench, cause those stools are killer.'
Priscilla Langsworth, a year ago, 1, 'The manager seemed very condescending. There‚Äôs a different vibe from what it used to be like last year. Not worth returning. The energy was definitely off.

Ariel Rech, 2 years ago, 2, 'I called at 12:15am on a Friday to ask if people were still riding the bull because my fiance and I wanted to get a drink and watch people attempt the bull. They said yes but that they would be shutting down the bull at 1am. We are a 10 minute walk away so we went thinking we would be able to watch a few people ride while we enjoyed a drink. We got there at 12:30am and they decided to shut down early and refused a group of well mannered guys who wanted to ride the bull. I was a little upset but we had just gotten our drinks so I decided that I would finish my drink and leave. Before 1am, the bar decides that they don\'t want to stay open any longer, even though they are supposed to stay open till 2am on Fridays and Saturdays. They yelled "last call" and then literally 5 minutes later they told everyone to get out. They started putting the chairs on the tables, they turned on the super bright lights, turned off the music and forced everyone to get out. I wasn\'t even half way through my drink and it wasn\'t even close to 2am yet. There was about 15 people in the bar so it wasn\'t that they wanted to close due to no customers. If your website says you are open till 2am, you need to stay open till 2am instead of taking people\'s money, letting them buy drinks, and then shoving them out the door more than an hour before closing time.'

Mel Bilecky, 3 years ago, 1, 'This place was horrific. The servers and management were disrespectful, rude and not accommodating. I went with a large group for a night out for a friend‚Äôs bday and we got kicked out for not ordering food. Save your money and spend it somewhere else.'
Sharlys Leszczuk, 3 years ago, 3, "The atmosphere here is so weird. We went and there was no one there. It made it awkward to be waited on by the bartender, because everyone was hanging out as if there were no customers, but we were there trying to enjoy a meal. The food was okay but with all the other great restaurants in Hoboken, I probably won't return."
Frank C, 3 years ago, 4, "Very nice place. If you like whiskey and bourbon go here.  I went during the day and we had fun. I'm sure the mechanical bull can be fun at night. Food was good too. It did come out cold, and yes I sent it back. I know, always a worry at every restaurant, right? But it tasted so much better hot.  I'll go back again."

They carry some local brews on tap, other than that its a decent bar in Hoboken."

I cannot comment on the food, the drinks, the specials, or anything else because my friends and I were not even acknowledged. Here we are, a group of 6 and no one even greets us? The place wasn\'t really full, nearly empty, there were employees behind the bar and some on the floor, I believe. We weren\'t offered a menu, a place to sit, a drink, not even a "hello" or "welcome".  Our anticipation of bull riding was very short lived. Needless to say, after standing there for about 10 minutes with no one offering assistance we left, and ended up at Applesbees.'

They've got a long bar, so getting a drink isn't too tough, and the mechanical bull is a fun added bonus if you're feeling like it.\n\nAs for drinks, they've got a fantastic selection of bourbon and whisky. They've got the staple beers as well as a few good crafts. I enjoyed it here and I'd make it a spot on my next night out. Especially if I'm with someone who hasn't ridden a mechanical bull before."

We had the Spinach and Artichoke dip (1/2 off) and the Calamari (regular price).  Artichoke dip was pretty good, but the calamari was absolutely amazing.  It's covered in buffalo sauce and comes with blue cheese on the side.  If you love buffalo wings, you'll love this dish."
Stephanie Tom, 6 years ago, 5, "Hands down the best brunch in Hoboken. Formerly the Gaslight, the Stewed Cow inherited the infamous $20 brunch that includes an entree, some breakfast snacks like a plate of muffins, fruit and oatmeal, and two cocktails (choices include either a beer, a manmosa (usually blue moon+vodka+oh), mimosas, sangria, bloody mary, etc)! The brunch selections are all great, you can't go wrong, but if you're feeling really decadent, get the roadkill platter (but I'd suggest replacing scrambled eggs with sunnyside or over easy eggs because who doesn't love a runny yolk)."
Ruta P, 6 years ago, 1, "They wouldn't let us in at 130 am on a Friday night (The sign outside the door days no admittance after 2am). It was my best friends 30th birthday and instead of letting us in for one drink, the bouncer called her spoiled for wanting to get in."

Tyler Lund, 8 years ago, 4, 'Grab a whiskey cocktail and hop up on the mechanical bull, or just relax with friends at this popular Hoboken bar. A little off the beaten path in Hoboken, this bar has a much calmer atmosphere than the typical Hoboken bar and is very popular with the locals. There were even several strollers parked inside during happy hour which is always a good sign in Hoboken. The libation menu features a huge bourbon list, a good draught beer selection, and some delicious cocktails that will help you work up the courage to ride the mechanical bull in the back. Even so, it is far from a raucous crowd here, even on a Friday at 11:30pm. I tried the bacon flavored "pork chops and appleasuce", probably my favorite drink of the night, then the Mule Kicker, but with tequila instead of gin, then the chocolate infused Cocoa old fashioned, which was tasty, but very heavy. I also had the bacon, bleu, and hot sauce burger which was incredible. The meat was excellently seasoned, rare for bars in the area and the toppings mixed very well together. The fries were also very tasty. I also stole one of our friends\' bourbon wings which was very tasty and cooked well and nice and crispy.  Service was very good, though because we started with only drinks, they didn\'t come by incredibly often. The bartender suggested a whiskey for us and though I didn\'t love it, I appreciated the knowledge of the products they had.'
