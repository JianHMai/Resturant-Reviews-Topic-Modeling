Rich Milito, a year ago, 5, "What a great venue. We attended a 50th birthday party last Saturday night in this really cool restored turn-of-the-century building. The staff was amazing, the waitstaff did a great job with passed hors d'oeuvres, interacting with the guests and doing the little extra things like bringing over some cheese bites after my wife declined some previous items saying she preferred fried stuff. The bartenders were quick and efficient, showing off the cocktail making skills and producing some great drinks. The buffet was well stocked and the staff made sure the chafing dishes were stocked and hot. Street parking was easy to find, actually parked right in front of the door. Heard there is a lot nearby put didn't need it. Great time was had by all."

Sabrina Nicole Terry, 3 years ago, 2, "The food wasn't for my taste but it's a nice place to do an event. Not alot of parking available on the street sides but they do have a parking lot. I wasn't very satisfied with my stay at an event going there. It could have been better and more organized. Also, enough room to party that's for sure. They should have someone know how to get into the place it could be confusing if you haven't been there."
Conrad's Concessions Events, 3 years ago, 5, "Super professional staff!  I'd like to single out Vince for his exceptional customer service and punctuality.  From start to end Vince was an absolute delight to work with and very prompt with returning our calls and emails.  He was very quick to address any needs we had and would highly recommend this company to anyone!"
Mandi Abdalla Hernandez-Jimenez (MahJ), 3 years ago, 5, 'Magical venue with great GREAT space & BAR, magical bar (had a yummy cocktail called Sex on The Moon), great for live music, elevator access and mock tails so the non drinking company can enjoy themselves as well.'

Elvis Tam, 4 years ago, 4, "Visited Kolo Klub first time for a B'Day party. Great place to hang out and enjoy some creative and fun delightful drinks. Bartenders are friendly and well skilled with drinks and  really enjoy their work. Will be back. BTW, drink prices are just right. Place is on the 2nd floor, above Pilsener Haus  (Awesome pretzels and Sausage and beer selections). Will find parking as well around the place because of the location.. However be careful and read ALL posted signs.. You are in Hoboken.."
