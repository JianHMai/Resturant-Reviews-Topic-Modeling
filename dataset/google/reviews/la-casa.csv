Stephanie Ortiz, a month ago, 5, 'La Casa is by far our favorite restaurant in Hoboken. It‚Äôs like my grandmas cooking but healthier and delicious (don‚Äôt tell abuela). After a few years of obsessing over la casa, both friends and family also love the restaurant. Either ordering out or enjoying the hole in the wall quaint feeling in person. This weekend we asked la casa to cater our rehearsal dinner, everyone was so excited and la casa delivered above and beyond. Even with 2 hrs of traveling with the food it tasted so fresh and delicious. We ordered everything from rice, yuca, croquettas, pernil but the ropa vejia and cubanos won many people‚Äôs hearts. The coconut cake and guava cheesecake left within seconds too. Thank you la casa for making the start of the wedding weekend unforgettable for us. We knew our stomachs would be happy and ready for the next day. Highly recommend la casa for a dinner night or event. Alan was amazing to work with!!'

followJTusa JT USA, 3 months ago, 4, "(Hoboken.jan). Latin Food that tastes homecooked? La Casa at 54 Newark street offers you a taste of the most tender Rabo Encidido, oxtail that is not just an exclusively Latin dish but is a also a universal favorite enjoyed by meat lovers from Africa to the Pacific. Peeking at you from a hot cabinet or food warmer are a variety of Empanadas, Croquetas, and Papa Rellena that can be seen from outside through the glass window. They even offer Guava and cheese empanadas - which I'm dying to try. My fave so far is the Spinach and Cheese. There's Beef (carne with olives) and Chicken (Pollo). The empanadas taste fresh and are made in-house. It is easy to miss the tiny door that leads to a cozy and intimate atmosphere. The menu offerings include standard Latin favorites such as Chicken, Chorizos, Beef and sides that include Beans, a selection of Rice, Yuca, Maduros -you name it, they have it in what seems to be small place. BTW, let's not forget that a good meal is not complete without dessert!  The bar displays a coconut cake or a chocolate enclosed in a glass stand. Coffee is served here. The Weekday Specials have entrees that come with 2 sides, a tradition followed by most Spanish restaurants. Generous portions of sides are your choice of: Arroz Moro for me; Arroz Amarillo, etc. Sandwiches are also offered. And Brunch on week-ennds startvearlty. Check for schedules and changes due to changing COVID protocols. Make sure you say, easy on the salt please! (At least for me)."

During my first visit I had this dish with a side of maduros, rice and beans. They have an amazing garlic sauce to pair the dish with you can ask for it on the side but make sure you add lime to the steak and the garlic sauce on top of it.

Devante Phillip, 6 months ago, 1, "**DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT**\n\nAfter eating with my family to celebrate an early Mother's Day celebration, the beef within the empanada and the oil used to fry the empanada and plantains was OLD and the meat used was not prepared properly.  The poor preparation of their appetizers/entrees caused my mother to upchuck the dishes and caused her to go to hospital due to food poisoning, which was confirmed by the hospital's doctor. Also, the rest of my family, including myself, was feeling nauseous and sickly after consuming their food.\n\nI will never approach this restaurant again and I highly suggest that no one else consume their food until a complete clean-out of their restaurant commences.  If not, this restaurant should be shut down."

Lynnette Medrano, 11 months ago, 1, "I had no choice but to leave one star, I would have left none, I should have thoroughly read the reviews as the common denominator in them is about customer service and forgetting orders. It is Thanksgiving day and because things are different this year, we decided to do a catering order with La Casa. We placed an order on November 4 with a follow up confirmation about a week later for pick up; payment was also made on Nov 4.\nToday, we arrive to pick up our order and we are met with closed doors and a sign stating the restaurant has not been open since Nov 21. During times like these, it is alarming to know that this restaurant couldn't give us a phone call to cancel the order. Moreover, you would think there are protocols in place and the fact that this was completely overlooked makes me wonder what other simpler tasks may be falling by the waistline. I was informed that the owner of this restaurant is the same one as the pizzeria establishment in the corner (across from CVS). I visited both locations this morning as none of the workers were able to provide me with contact information for a supervisor, and further did not have it themselves. Whether or not they were trying to occult this information is fine, but someone could have at least reached out internally for further guidance. Its unfortunate their workers were like me, with no information and also frustrated on my behalf.\n\nDo better La Casa, for those who may count on you in the future while trying to create memories during these taxing times. I will never place an order with this restaurant and I would recommend to think twice if you're considering catering."

La Casa is pretty small (and narrow), but there weren't too many people dining there - probably because it was a weird time.\n\nTo start, we had the chicken empanada, spinach/cheese empanada, and the ham croquette. The empanadas were only okay. They didn't seem too fresh, especially since they took them out of one of those food heaters, but they weren't terrible. The croquette was pretty good.\n\nFor my main, I had the cuban sandwich. This would have been really good, had they not drenched the bread in butter. I was able to smell all the butter as our waiter was walking towards us with the plate. BF had some kind of pork plate, which comes with two sides so he opted for rice and french fries. For all of this food, we paid $32, which includes tax and tip. Pretty great deal. I'd come back and try some of their other sandwiches but next time, I'll tell them to go easy on the butter."
