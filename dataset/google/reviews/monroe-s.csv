Everyone said they had a great time. A few people said "when I have a baby shower, this is what I want." The day couldn\'t have gone better.'

Kristina K, 4 months ago, 3, 'Monroe‚Äôs attempts to capture an upscale vibe with tufted chairs, black and white art canvases, and elegant chandeliers to feel part of the Marilyn Monroe era.\n\nI was excited to sit down until our very miserable waitress walked by, seemingly unamused and not wanting to be present.\n\nI saw a brunch price of $36 displayed on the menus. I asked about the brunch and she seemed very uninterested in retaining a customer. I inquired if there was any big pitcher options and she blatantly said no. She could have easily informed me of the larger scale sangria bottles and tell me about other offers available, but instead she just wanted to be done with the conversation.\n\nThe food was eh. Sushi was interesting, but not the freshest. Bao buns were not soft and lacked integrity.\n\nManager took notice of the bad rim on the drinks and had the drinks remade so I appreciate her efforts in salvaging a subpar experience. When the drinks did arrive, I had no complaints. They were definitely some of the better cocktails I have had in Hoboken\n\nManager salvaged our night.'

Kelly G, 4 months ago, 1, 'I am 38 weeks pregnant and was going for a walk with my mom from my apartment to the waterfront and I realized as I was walking by I had to pee. The restaurant had its doors open and two employees were setting up for dinner around 4:30. I walked in and apologized for bothering them but asked if I could use the bathroom (I am visibly very pregnant) and the woman at the hostess stand said "no its our policy not to allow you to." I said OK I am really pregnant and I can buy something if that helps and she still refused. What inhumane staff. I was just so shocked as was my mom that someone could be so cruel.'

Carolyn Vaccaro, 6 months ago, 3, "Email system to get into the speakeasy downstairs does not have their S*** together. When we went we had a reservation for 4:30 which wasn't even a thing apparently. If you are going to have an email to submit for reservation downstairs at the Sinatra Room, then you need to get your reservations straight. Plus while we waited we got a drink at Monroe's and it took FOREVER and the recipe did not even have the correct ingredients in it.\n\nThe Sinatra Room was a good experience regardless though- would go back there. But get your s*** together with the two businesses."

Megan Gillen, 6 months ago, 3, 'The food itself was tasty, but the entire atmosphere was quite strange. All of the decor was themed based off of Marilyn Monroe but the food was a asian fusion with sushi being the majority of the menu which I was not expecting. The lighting was very dim, making it hard to see the people I was at the table with and the music was very loud so I needed to shout to be heard.'

Cassandra Jones, 6 months ago, 2, 'Ugh, this pains me. I‚Äôm big on reviews and have never written one as lengthy as this one.\n\nMy first visit was absolutely AMAZING! So much so that I returned with a few more folks during my second visit which was bad. Bad to the point I‚Äôm really contemplating returning. Mind you, the food and ambience are amazing, as evident in the pictures below. It was the service or lack of, that rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nOur server (I believe his name was Mario) was kind when greeting us after we were seated at our table but it went downhill from there. We ordered our drinks with no problem but he asked for our IDs after ordering a bottle of champagne which was odd to me as our first order contained alcoholic beverages. We complied, he checked two of ours (we were a party of 4) and then abruptly left the table without checking IDs of the other two or saying anything which also struck us as odd but whatever, we were here to celebrate my birthday so we were in great spirits. We placed an order of various sushi rolls and appetizers which were AMAZING - sushi tasted so fresh however, after we were done, we went to place our main courses and the server says oh the kitchen is closed, so now we‚Äôre all shocked like huh. He mentioned (at that time which was after 10:45pm) that the kitchen closes at 10:30pm, but not once did he approach us as the time neared 10:30pm to say ‚Äúwould you like to order additional food‚Äù etc., - nothing. So he says he‚Äôll try and ask the manager if they can make an exception, the manager says no (according to him). I‚Äôm with a party of 4, 1 of us previously worked as a server for over 10 years and another currently serves as a general manager of a restaurant. Both were livid. The manager came over and while she was very kind, she wasn‚Äôt much help beyond saying she would comp another round of drinks but at this point we don‚Äôt want drinks, we need dinner so we ask our server for the check. He returns almost 10 min later with drinks and we told him we didn‚Äôt want it so I kindly asked if the manager can comp our first round instead as we weren‚Äôt going to drink the second round. At this point, our server has an attitude and the GM of our group proceeds to speak with the manager and it went nowhere so we paid and left. I still left him a nice tip, more than 18%, just because it‚Äôs hard times for everyone, especially the food service industry however, you want to spend money on great food AND great service.\n\nThe woman who manages the bar is EVERYTHING - absolutely love her. Will most likely return for her and her concoctions, once we‚Äôre allowed to sit at the bar.'

The service was on point.\nI will definitely return again and hopefully with friends. Everyone should definitely try this place out. Also, music was amazing and you can find it on Spotify under Sinatra Room. ü•∞üòç'
J P, 8 months ago, 5, "For the Sinatra Room.\n\nWe had the pleasure of making a reservation at the Sinatra room.\n\nGreat spot. Located in Monroe's. Shhhhh‚Ä¶.that's all I can tell you.\n\nYou can make your own res through email. Check the Sinatra Rooms Instagram for details.\n\nThe place was incredible from the moment we walked in, till we secretly left. LOL. Our waitress Marie with her expert knowledge, helped guide us to several wonderful cocktails. Melanie behind the bar was excellent. The cocktails were designed beautifully, well balanced and frankly just delicious. I also thought the complimentary small tasting cocktail was all class.\n\nThe vibe was incredible; decorated beautifully, warmly lit and a unique musical experience. Don't worry their Spotify playlist is public so you can stalk them.\n\nWe will definitely be back friends...soon we hope. Thanks for this awesome creation."

Damian Gladysz, 8 months ago, 5, "Second time me and my girlfriend went to Monroe's  for Dinner. First time we decided to go with friends and order drinks & a bunch of apps. We had Eda-Mami, Rose Fries, Cry Me  a River, Call Me Marie, Why You Cheesin?& Yammy Fries. All were delicious in their own ways. Melanie our bartender served us up some fantastic cocktails and was an over all great experience which was the reason we decided to go back for Valentines Day for their dinner + Sinatra Room Speak easy. I'm usually not a big fan of a prefix menu but this was by far one of the best dinners my girlfriend and i had in a very long time. The soups, salad and entrees were incredible with so much flavor. (We discuss how good the crab salad was at least once a week.) She got the teriyaki chicken and I got the steak. and we both ended up sharing each others food because we couldn't figure out which was better. After the dinner we went down stairs to the Sinatra Room where Melanie once again served us THE BEST cocktails. What a way to end the night. Will be coming back regularly!"
Joana Dunhao, 8 months ago, 5, "Monroe's is indisputably the place to dine and drink in Hoboken. The service, food and drinks were top tier both times that I dined, one of them being Valentine's Day. An obviously busy day for the restaurant industry and Monroe's added to my perfectly splendid night. Their five course meal was satisfying at every bite.\n\nThe night ended at the Sinatra's Room, the speakeasy below Monroe's and our bartender Melanie made our night no less than complete. Her amiable personality brings light to your experience.\n\n10/10, would definitely recommend!"
Anna Pomales, 8 months ago, 1, "Let me start by saying this is the coolest idea.\n\nThe Sinatra room speakeasy downstairs has great cocktails. We did have to wait over 30 minutes for each round so by the end of our 90 minutes time limit, we had just received our third drink.\n\nWe had booked a dinner reservation for upstairs at Monroe's after the speakeasy reservation. The speakeasy reservation ran over because the drinks so long so we went upstairs to the Monroe's hostesses about 9:30. I explained that we had made a post speakeasy reservation for dinner and the reservation downstairs ran long. The one hostess told me to give them 5-10 minutes to clear the table and they'd seat us. After about 20 minutes, I approached the other hostess to ask about the status of our reservation. She nastily responded to me that i didn't actually have a reservation and that they were doing what they can. I told her I had both email and text confirmation of the reservation and showed her the text message. She then told me the table was being cleared and it'd be about 5 minutes. About 10 minutes later, she told me the party was leaving and we'd be seated. We waited almost an hour to get seated after initially being told it'd be 5-10 minutes.\n\nOnce seated, we were not provided or offered water: the waiter came over and asked for our drink and small plates order. I ordered a couple of plates of the fries and we as a group ordered some cocktails and additional appetizers. A few minutes later, the waiter came back and asked for our entree orders. At this point, I asked for water because it still had not been provided or offered.\n\nWe received cocktails before the sodas that were ordered. We receive entrees before the appetizers. The order of fries was a joke compared to the price. The slush orders did not come with soy sauce. When you asked for soy sauce, you received a tiny plastic container.\n\nThe staff at Monroe's made us feel unwelcomed, and the drinks and food did not make up for it. This is a great idea with terrible execution. In addition, the women's bathroom was disgusting. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days and stalls were missing toilet paper.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go elsewhere."

Alex Kin, a year ago, 3, 'While visiting we went to Monroe\'s for their brunch. The host/waitress was extremely accommodating. We were feeling brunch.\n\nDrinks were awesome, I got the Bellini. Great serving size. The food was a different story. It was odd Asian fusion food (e.g. egg roll cheese cake, bacon egg sushi) with flavors that were not complementary. Also "medium rare steak" came out well done (cardinal sin of steaks). Waitress was super nice when I was honest about my feedback, and the 2nd steak was medium well.\n\nDining experience was okay because of the quality of service and company. Food maybe better for taking pictures of than to eat.'

I then took it back to work not even 10 min. later do i open the container to eat it there was only like 8 little rock hard tiny french fries and the burger was like a hockey puck! Not only did they over cook it but was overloaded with salt, i paid $16.00  for this aggravation so i called Monroe's they didn't want to know anything, i asked them to refund my debit card they wouldn't! Also the manager would not even come to the phone. So i called my debit card company to reverse the charges instead!"

Kevin Yllanes, a year ago, 1, 'So i went to this restaurant for the first time on the 8th of this month had no issues with the food, in fact i like it so much i finished it all and ask for more but unfortunately the kitchen had closed by then. But i have to say the service was really really BAD I MEAN BAD, never or less there was on waitress that actually understand our frustration of how the food that we ordered was served. Taking my first ordered with the previous waitress was a little uncomfortable due to lack of experience even when she took down my ordered she ask me to bring it because kitchen was closing soon that i understood, then came my friends ordered we where all seperate at a table of 7 due to each of us where going to odered diferrent food at our convinience, we all ordered different food never of less they gave us 5 different types of food and it was all served in one plate never seen that so then chef came to the table and had to show us whos food was whos because even the waitress didnt know how to separated i was already disgusted by the service one of my friends had to eat on a small plate in order to seperate the food that he had ordered, and thats excluding all that stuff like i had my food served and had no fork to eat with waited almost 15 min to bring them to me than i ask for sauce also had to wait mind you that the restaurant was practically empty i had to repeatedly ask for ice never of less there where a lot of things. So after all of this one my friends ask for a discount being that the service wasnt that good. So the manager came to the table and said no wich was ok that i understood because the food wasnt the problem and she was right we ate we finished it we neverd complained on the food. But even thou when the check came i saw they charged us with a gratitude of 20% wich by law is their right cause we where 7 people on the table but in my opinion or at least in rare occasions other restaurants would‚Äôve have done at least something to accommodate you for the bad service that was provided i was refusing to pay the gratitude due to the lack of experience and the audacity of the manager practically telling us you ate the food you finished the food there was no problem with the food. I repeatedly told her that i never complained on the food not once that wasnt the issue what it was, was the service that was provided to me my wife and the rest of my friends so tell me where im wrong tell me if it isnt my right to tell you that your service was bad and that you didnt provided 100% customer satisfaction. I hope this will provide some experience towards your reastaurant and you can offer better service towards your clients.'
