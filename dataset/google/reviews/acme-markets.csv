Claudio Sousa, a day ago, 1, 'As another reviewer said, the store seems to be in extremely poor management. It‚Äôs hardly ever stocked on produce, and what is there is often old. The seafood section is gross and often smells so terrible it fills that section of the store(they have dozens of king crab legs on display and they never seem to cycle them out)'

Sometimes I would go look around before I started work, to see if there was anything I would purchase later. The afternoon manager, I don't know his name, but he resembled a run over chipmunk came over to me and in a very passive aggressive way accused me of being a shoplifter! I was so flabbergasted by such an accusation I didn't know how to react. They have security footage of me doing nothing but browsing.  I recommend don't shop there,  they act like their PAYING customers are criminals."

They know they need to compete and they have been rising to the occasion.  It's a solid alternative to Shoprite."
