I said please give us a minute to look at the menu. Sixty seconds later, the waiter comes back. I ordered gelato. Finished it and was given the check and told I had ten minutes. We were probably there for a total of 30 minutes and had a half bottle of wine (byob + corking fee).  I inquired w the waiter why we had to leave and he said there‚Äôs a time limit of 90 minutes (we were about an HOUR below that).  He said if you ordered more food you can stay the 90 (which is insane, we more wine to go through). Also, I probably would have ordered more wine. I thought oh they must have a long line (meanwhile it‚Äôs a random Wednesday night). Nope. No one waiting. The most rushed restaurant experience EVER. I felt more at ease with time limits during covid than I did tonight. Such bad service and etiquette.'

We LITERALLY told him to bring whatever is good.  We started a big wooden tray of delish...  Prosciutto and cheese and grapes...  Yumzo...  Then with some octopus üêô personally I am not a fan, but it was sooooooo good.  A couple green salads (again not a fan, but the table gobbled them up...)\nBring on the üçï pizza...  We had 4 pies...  A goat cheese honey pie, just order it like that...  They will know what ur talking about...  Jaw dropping delish...  Such a safari for ur taste buds...  U will believe me when u eat it...  A diablo sauced stunner and a marina "total simplicity offering"...\nThe pasta was sooooooo perfect. The texture and the al dente firmness...  Woe...  The gelato was spot on also...  We r food snobs so I must say, it was simple utter perfection...  One of our lunch guests has travelled to over 80 countries and gave a 2 thumbs up...

Not to mention being given the shakedown for an extra $3.00 at the end of my ($22 pizza) meal to meet the $25 per person minimum didn‚Äôt exactly leave a good taste in my mouth.

Every part of the dinner from the service to the food to the BYOB was superb.  We started off with the Prosciutto de Parma which I highly recommend. I can still taste the fresh prosciutto!   For entrees we had three pizzas and two pasta dishes.  The pasta was al dente; the sauces on the pasta dishes were perfect and the ingredients on the pizzas just oozed fresh!   The pizza is simply to-die-for!  We topped it off with Apulia's homemade gelato desserts for which there are no words to describe.   People who in these reviews complained about the price point are simply cheap or don't know great food when they get it.  In the past, we have had to travel to Edgewater or North Bergen to get really good brick/coal oven pizza.  Not any more.  This diamond in the rough is our new go-to spot!  Thank you Franco and Pasqua for a wonderful evening!"

Although the sign on the storefront refers to a "pizza" place, and that\'s where they have the most options on the menu, it is so much more. The Italian style gourmet pizza that we had was delicious. It did remind me of the pizza in Italy. Great seafood- prawns, swordfish, salmon and sushi grade tuna antipasti was amazing! The pasta dishes were served "aldente" which is personally how I love pasta. The staff was friendly and attentive. Good espresso is a must and I wasn\'t disappointed. Great for groups of all kinds and all ages. Indoor and outdoor seating in the front and rear options for sun or shade. Don\'t forget to BYOB.'

Robert Lurie, 2 years ago, 5, "Overall, place had a good atmosphere and is really nice, definetly a great addition to uptown Hoboken. Not much to describe as far as atmosphere, they clearly do focus on food, as evidence by the massive brick pizza oven and equally huge manual fly wheel slicer for fresh Prosciutto de Parma. It's also byob which is a huge plus. The place is not huge, and as such waits can be long at times, luckily there a couple bars near by to grab a drink.\n\nMenu is limited, but they have been expanding, and usually have a few good specials. Last time, we ordered the pesto gnocchetti, which was good, but I felt needed a little more garlic. We also ordered 2 pizzas, the inferno and the caprina. Both are delicious Neapolitan\xa0style pizza.  After being there a few times, all of the pizzas are delicious. Dessert is also very good, with my wife's favorite being the Nutella calzone.\n\nOverall food is delicious, service and organization have been improving, as there were a couple stumbles in the beginning.

I may be bias because the cuisine leans towards the region of Italy of my roots, but this only adds to its uniqueness among the standard fare. I removed a star only because I like my pizza crust a bit thinner and crispier, but that\'s just me.'

Daniel deCavaignac, 2 years ago, 3, 'Dining room and service were quite good.   Nothing super special but nothing bad either.   I just don‚Äôt like the value on the pizza.   It‚Äôs good pizza with thin crust and good quality ingredients but the pizzas are 4 slice personal pies for $18+ Each..   3 of us ate 1 pizza each for lunch and after tip and tax it was $68.  Wow.   Hoboken has a ton of pizza places and I am just not sure this price point remains viable.'

Ben Guyamier, 2 years ago, 5, "Great pizza with phenomenal service.\nWe dropped in on a Saturday at 6:30 with an infant AND a toddler expecting to be told we needed a reservation. Not only did they seat us right away, but they put us at a great table in the back.\nSince it's BYOB, the waiter pointed me to a local wine store 1 block away.\nThe white pizza was AWESOME! And highly recommend the pistachio desert.\nMusic was also great. when we asked the name of a song that played, the owner came over to talk to us about the music and how he ended up picking the location.\nOverall a great, unexpected, night out. Haven't had customer service this great in a long time.\nThanks Frank and crew!"
