The food is fairly unremarkable—the quality of the food was under average which is a real disappointment given the prices. The only good thing about this restaurant is the cute ambiance.'

Rene Rosa, a month ago, 5, "The staff was very nice and the food tasted great. For what came out to about 30 per person, (no alcohol purchased) it was incredibly small portions. The Eggs Bella Vista tells you it comes with Argentinian sausages but what you actually get is one sausage split in half. The home style potatoes were great but you could fit the serving in the palm of a child's hand. It's a shame, because the staff were so nice and dutiful and the food tastes great. 1 English muffin for $4, that was soft and limp, was supposedly toasted. The average brunch or breakfast spot gives you toast with your meal, here you have to buy it and it's not even done well. We left hungry and went to Rumba's in Jersey City for a 2nd meal that wound up costing about $5 a person. Never again."

Ewan Fisher, 3 months ago, 5, "This venue really disappoints. On first impressions it looks great. Classy establishment, live music and friendly staff. The menu is quite limited but the vibe gives it the feel of, offer little and do it really well. How restaurants should be rather than offering a huge selection that they will never be able to do right. However the food was a massive let down, especially compared to the venue itself.  The only way I can describe it is cheap bar food disguised in a charming venue. The chicken, served with boxed pasta, had a soapy taste to so much so that it wasn't something I could finish. The short rib however was well cooked but presented like it should be in an average bar.\n\nThe location and vibe must be holding this place higher in rating than it deserves. Either that or the chef was off that night and it didn't meet its usual standard. Left very disappointed, would not recommend."

The walls are full of beautiful art peaces.\nThe only downside is that it was a bit pricey, but we knew that going in. I totally think it was worth it!"

Gene Rabinovich, 5 months ago, 5, 'We had a nice and relaxing family brunch there on a Saturday morning. The place was not crowded, with patrons peppering the space here and there. Overall, good experience, as we went there open-minded and ready to try new places (new to us anyway) in Hoboken. The restaurant had an easy-going and breezy atmosphere with tables spaced out wide apart and the French doors overlooking the backyard wide open. If you are looking for some quality and familiar American cuisine, Amanda’s will fit the bill.'

They have a full bar my boyfriend got a cocktail and I got a local beer on draft. The beer was awesome and I love that they support local breweries. They had live music and everyone as very covid safe. The band was wearing masks and so was all the staff. The tables were distant and I felt very safe being there. The food was amazing and when they brought us out the dessert it was sweet that it said happy anniversary I would definitely recommend for a get dressed up girls night out or a date night.

The experience during our first visit last month was great, so we decided to return and it was everything we were hoping for and more! It left you with that very rare feeling that you got way more than what you paid for. If all this wasn’t enough, add the presence of the very talented pianist playing a the perfect repertoire to make your dining experience even greater. Five starts don’t seem enough to rate Amanda’s, I would easily give them ten. We strongly recommend this restaurant!'

Karoline M., 2 years ago, 5, 'I’m sorry but Amanda’s is so overrated. Yes, the location is beautiful and historic but the main reason to go to a restaurant is the food, and it it always a hit or miss situation: either really bad, or mediocre/ok at best. We’ve come here three times due to invitations, and have been disappointed twice.\n\nWhen coming in with a party of five, the food was not hot upon serving, and one dish came late. And it wasn’t even busy, it was after 2pm when the main brunch crowd already disappeared.\n\nThe lemon pancakes, supposed signature dish, did not only arrive late but were mostly burnt (the 2 black-dark brown BURNED PANCAKES were covered up with a medium-brown one), and the whipped butter on top had been erroneously replaced with savory herb butter, creating an involuntarily unbalanced sweet and savory combination.\n\nThe SALMON EGGS BENEDICT tasted fishy - yes, I get that it’s fish but it was fishy in a bad way. I regularly savor salmon in all forms (raw, marinated, baked, sautéed, hot smoked, cold smoked) but this one was really off and briny tasting. The spinach tasted bitter and had soaked up liquid, creating an unpleasantly mushy texture. The eggs were on point but were sadly unseasoned, the potatoes were mushy and flavorless, and the side lettuce was literally undressed.\n\nThe LOBSTER PANZANELLA was ok - however panzanella is supposed to be a bread salad, and this one was just topped with a few croutons, which tasted prepackaged. So technically not panzanella (just call it lobster salad).\n\nFinally, the coffees were disappointing, the latte and cappuccino were basically filter coffee with half and half, served in the same mug as the filter coffee, instead of a tall glass, with foamy milk and a dash of cocoa, how it’s supposed to be. I get I’m not at a roastery but it’s a brunch place so I expect the coffee to be good. Why even offer anything but filter coffee if you can’t deliver.'

Food is disappointing, always luke warm. If you get side fries with your dish, they taste like they were from yesterday. You order pancakes, they put in herb butter.\n\nIf you go to a place like this, you'd expect good food, food that you cannot make at home. Well let me tell you, if I cook whatever I order at this place, it tastes better, and it's being served hot.\n\nStaff friendly-ness is hit and miss. Our waiter yesterday had an annoyed vibe on her."

The duck confit was the star of the show. I would definitely recommend getting that. The desserts were also fantastic. Each dish was well though out and the flavors were amazingly balanced."
Shubha Joshi, 2 years ago, 5, "Beautiful ambience. The food is good but the service is best. Street parking at Hoboken can be found few blocks down. I would recommend reservation to avoid wait. They also have a private room but I'm not sure how many people it can fit. You may not get a lot of vegetarian choices (the only reason I took off a star) though so make sure you ask them to modify the dishes to suit your diet preferances."

Alonzo Cudd, 3 years ago, 5, "A HOBOKEN GEM\n\nWe were here visiting family and found this well rated restaurant on Google maps (where else?). We were eating with an infant and came in right when they opened at 5pm. I know this isn't a normal dining time for most people but the advantage was that they had an early dinner menu which was such a good deal that two people from our party ordered off of it.\nI had their Summer Vegetable Risotto which had butternut squash that was the perfect firmness and fresh peas that were bursting with flavor all complimented with some of the best risotto I've ever had. The menu overall is very well rounded and they have a great cocktail, wine, and local beer menu.\nThe staff was very professional and attentive. We got two visits from their very friendly and accommodating dining room manager. Overall the service was perfect especially considering we came a 2 year old which often times can leave us feeling treated like lepers."
Eileen R., 3 years ago, 5, "Small, noisy but lovely. A continental menu. The normal prices are expensive, but if you can get there for their early bird, it's certainly worth the price ($19). You get three courses, and a bottle of house wine is $25. The waitstaff is terrific. You'll find your drinking glasses filled without even asking. Try the key lime pie for dessert. It comes with berries and a dollop of real whipped cream. Yummy. Parking is a real problem, but they have an arrangement with a nearby garage."

We had a party of 7 and we did a lot if talking and laughing together,  and at no time did anyone feel like we were being rushed though the meal.  The food was prepared as ordered, with several of us having different eggs Benedict choices, a few omelets, and several other selections from the brunch menu.  One of my eggs was slightly overcooked, which is the only reason I didnt rate the place a 5.   The sides were generous portions as were the main courses.  All in all, I will return for sure to try out the rest of the menu.  We came on a Sunday, late morning  and there was plenty of street parking.  Not sure if the parking would be as easy in the evening, but there are lots nearby.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed."

The service in most all Hoboken eateries is horrific (snotty, lazy, arrogant students) but at Amanda's, they are clearly well trained. There are however, three things I wish Amanda's had (1) Wifi (my kid wants to watch videos while waiting for his food) (2) Whole wheat bread/rolls (yes, their white rolls are tasty but Hoboken is packed with health concious people; please update and offer healthy rolls) (3) More veggie options (seriously lacking vegetarian options as well as veggie sides). But as you can see, I still love the place, hence the 5 star rating."

The food is great and the atmosphere is almost private and certainly a bit romantic.  The place reminds me of a study in an old estate.  One thing I do note is that our waiter cracked the cork while opening our wine and either did not notice or did not care as he attempted to serve us a glass full of cork to taste...  When I pointed this out, he grabbed a different glass from another table and poured us some more wine with cork chunks into it...  That's really not a very acceptable response.  He finally admitted that he might need to get a new bottle after I pointed out that I saw him crack the cork and that the entire bottle was filled with cork pieces.  Other than this hiccup, dinner was great!"

Melanie Tam, 4 years ago, 5, "I never knew I liked truffle so much until Amanda's. For me, truffle was just another mushroom: basic AF. But their Truffle Fusilli pasta has opened my eyes to a whole new world. I felt like I was riding on a magic carpet when I ate it. But I'll get to that a bit later.\n\nMy BF, his parents, and I arrived at around 8 on a Friday but we were seated almost immediately. The place is small. I'm not sure if they accept ressos but if they do, it would be a good idea to make them.\n\nA lot of the appetizers appealed to us, but not so much the entrees. So we decided to just order a bunch of appetizers, and a pasta, and share everything. This is what we ordered:\n\nGrilled Octopus with chorizo, fingerling potatoes, salsa verde, sorrel ($16) - both the octopus and the chorizo were very chewy. I wouldn't recommend this.\n\nCreamy Polenta with sausage ragu, shaved parmesan ($10) - the flavor was okay but the texture was definitely not what I was expecting. I don't know if I would call this 'creamy polenta'. A block of polenta would be more accurate.\n\nChef's Charcuterie Board (cured meats, aged cheese, pickled vegetables, crackers, spread - $16) - the spread is some kind of bacon jam (?) Not exactly sure what it was but it was amazing. That paired with either of the cheeses it came with, was perfect. The cured meats were just okay. Maybe cured meats is just not their forte.\n\nLamb Meatballs (special of the day) - I didn't taste any of the gaminess of the lamb, which either meant it was really good, or it was just a bunch of leftover ground mystery meat. Either way, this was pretty basic.\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least - the star of the show: Truffle Fusilli Pasta with roasted woodland mushrooms, sage, parmesan cheese, mushroom reduction ($24). This was everyone's favorite. They don't skimp on the pasta, and more importantly, they don't skimp on the truffle. I would most definitely come back just for this pasta. It's a tad pricy but truffle tends to be, and it's worth every penny.\n\nOverall, the appetizers were okay, but the pasta is what made me give Amanda's the 4 stars. Next time, I'll skip the apps and go straight for that pasta. Their brunch menu also sounds pretty good, and their prix fixe early dinner menu seems like a great deal. Can't wait to come back!\n\nTip - drinks are reasonably priced - the cheapest bottle of wine you can get is $30."

Elizabeth Markham, 5 years ago, 5, "I have heard such rave reviews for this place; honestly, I was pretty underwhelmed considering the price for brunch. I ordered the crispy eggs, and they were good - definitely unique - but they didn't blow me away. My partner got an omelette and he was also happy, but not extremely impressed. In addition, service was mixed; they were very attentive through the beginning of our meal, but I had to flag someone down twice for a coffee refill. Maybe they were just having an off day... It's a great space, and I really wanted to like it. I could imagine coming back for dinner.\n\nPS - The Sunday morning we were there, there were at least 4 large parties (two bridal showers, one birthday, and one event that was perhaps for business) - this place seems really equipped to deal with large parties."

I am not really an old-fashion type of person, nevertheless I can never say no to the acquaintance feeling it generated.\nWe ordered egg Benedict with salmon, as well as the crispy egg. Especially recommend the crispy egg, with melting yolk hiding in the center and covered by the crispy crust. Benedict was not special, but it was accompanied by fruits and fries, so a full combo. The room was quickly filled when we finished our brunch.Attentive service so will definitely come back.'

Ana Ruvalcaba, 7 years ago, 5, 'Early dinner at 5:30pm is an awesome deal! Three course pre-fixe menu for two for $32 and everything was fresh, had great flavors, and the service was impeccable. Two potential drawbacks are that it was pretty crowded (and therefore somewhat noisy) and the walking distance from the Path/Light Rail train is not far but would stink in bad weather. Regardless I enjoyed this place and will definitely be back.'
Candra Savage, 7 years ago, 5, "I had some of the worst service at this restaurant!  I love the food, local, and atmosphere of Amanda's but sadly have had really poor service.  It makes the money you spend there not worth it.  Attitude from the staff and no attention from the manager.  I will sadly not be going back."

Daniel Lieuwen, 8 years ago, 5, 'The 5 and 530 seatings are probably the best deal in Hoboken.  A 3-course meal for $16/person.  The food is scrumptious.\n\nThe service is good.  I was avoiding dairy and none of the desserts worked---so the waiter checked and got me sorbet instead.\n\nIf you come later, the price of main courses goes up to the high $20s.  Tried that once.  The portion was enormous---so leftovers for next day.\n\nThey used to play Big Band and Jazz, so much classier music choices than is normal in Hoboken.  The most recent visit though saw more recent music (Beatles through the 80s), which I liked less well.'
Sam Caino, 8 years ago, 5, "Fanciest restaurant in Hoboken.  A great place for a special occasion.  The New Year's Eve package was great.  It was a lot of fun dancing in between courses and ringing in the New Year.  Good band who took requests."

The menu was limited and grossly overpriced.  The service and staff were outstanding, as was the decor.  If only the quality of the meal was better and at a much more reasonable price point.  However, I am looking forward to going again to sample the "regular" menu.'
Jason Kaplan, 8 years ago, 5, 'Had no idea Hoboken had this type of romantic getaway.

John Farina, 10 years ago, 5, "The early bird dinner for two is wonderful food and such a bargain.  I would eat there 3 nites a week if it wasn't such a trek from No. Bergen County.   Parking is a pain but it's the price you pay for this gem.  Located just across the Hudson from the best the Big Apple has to offer and able to stand up to any of them."
Timothy Ericson, 10 years ago, 5, 'Amanda\'s is one of my favorite restaurants! I moved from the Hoboken area 8 years ago and still come back just to eat here. I was finally able to get back to the area this Sunday and of course grabbed dinner at Amanda\'s. When I made the reservation on opentable I noted that my friend was leaving for Australia the following day. When we ordered dessert, they surprised her by writing "Bon Voyage" on the plate in chocolate! Its the attention to small details that makes Amanda\'s a 5-star restaurant.'

Scott McAllister, 12 years ago, 5, 'food was absolutely fantastic - every part of the meal delivered in a big way.  mussels, endive salad, halibut, chorizo stuffed pork chop, and caramel apple tart.  pair this with a very reasonably priced wine list, and you have a top notch experience.'

If you are tired of pretentious restaurants with loud music, arrogant staff, over the top food with not flavor, then make your way to Amanda\'s. They also offer a famous "early bird menu" that is great value for money. I never get tired of Amanda\'s and hope that you will fall in love with it too!!'
