M M, 11 months ago, 1, 'Paid almost $40 for a SMALL personal Buffalo Chicken pie and a Chicken Caesar wrap.

Abraham Edens, 2 years ago, 1, 'Walking into Mario\'s, one feels very cozy, greeted by an array of delicious looking slices and cheap beer on tap. You order from the friendly staff and get your food and beer served to you at the table. You play some cards, eat your food, and drink your beer, having a good time in what you think is a good hangout spot. That is, until the owner, Mario, comes up to you and asks you WHY you had the audacity to play cards in his restaurant:\nMario: "What are you guys doing, playing cards? You order any food?"\nMe: "Yep, just playing some games, you can join us if you want"\nMario: "Listen, it\'d be ok if you were looking at nudie mags (yes, he actually said this) and ordering more beers. Stop the cards, order something, or leave"\nSo we stopped. And we left. Would have been a 5/5 without this guy ruining the ambiance.'

As far as gluten free pizza crust goes, most places taste like cardboard.  Mario's actually came close to real pizza crust.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It even came with its own plastic pizza cutter (nice touch).  Was it the best gluten free pizza I have ever had? definitely not.  Was it the worst? definitely not.  Would I eat it again?  Maybe."

S T, 6 years ago, 1, "I have been buying pies from Mario's for over 20 years. In the last year or so the pizza has changed. Tasteless, no tomato sauce.

They will be the end of your business Mario."
