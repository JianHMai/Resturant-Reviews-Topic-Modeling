The pizza I received was not at all close to the amazing pie I had witnessed. Add to this a less than welcoming hostess and a disinterested server  you begin to feel you'd made a terrible mistake.

jackeline Renteria, a year ago, 5, "(Translated by Google) The best pizza we bought two days in a row because we really liked the Brooklyn location and found this one in Hoboken near our hotel and two days in a row was our dinner! It's something from another world! Amazing the taste of pizza! Without a doubt 100% recommended this location is less crowded than that of Brooklyn I think people go more for the other because of the routes that make the famous Brooklyn Bridge but if you are in New Jersey it is the same and is obviously the same flavor !!\n\n(Original)\nLa mejor pizza compramos dos d√≠as seguidos porque nos gusto mucho la de la locaci√≥n de Brooklyn y encontramos esta en Hoboken cerca de nuestro hotel y dos d√≠as seguidos fue nuestra cena! Es algo de otro mundo!! Incre√≠ble el sabor de la pizza! Sin duda alguna recomendada al 100% esta locaci√≥n esta menos llena que la de Brooklyn yo creo la gente va m√°s para la otra por los recorridos que hacen al famoso Puente de Brooklyn pero si estas en Nueva Jersey es la misma y es obviamente el mismo sabor!!"

Crispy, slightly thicker crust with a crunch as you bite into it, and good flavor. They were able to get the pizza out to us in under 10 minutes - very nice since we were trying to catch a flight.

S RR, 3 years ago, 1, 'Just tried calling in for delivery, and was told they don\'t deliver to the Hoboken Andrew Jackson Public housing buildings, with no valid reason, other than "just because". I would understand if it were in a different town, but I can\'t believe it\'s 2018 and businesses are still profiling certain sectors of the towns they make their money in. Shame I\'ve never tried their pizza, and after today I don\'t have any interest in giving them my money; sticking to Delfinos!'

Danny Di, 3 years ago, 5, 'One of the best pizza places outside of Napoli.  Whenever I am in Hoboken I always come by for a pizza.  They use a Coal fired oven which gives the pizza a nice smokiness. The Margherita is my favourite.  But they‚Äôll make it anyway you want.  Just please don‚Äôt ask for pineapple. üëç'

Nick Lenzi, 3 years ago, 5, "Grimaldi's is consistently fantastic. Id recommend eating at Grimaldi's as opposed to doing take out or delivery because the cardboard box steams the pizza and takes the crunch out of it. My wife and I love getting a large pie with pepperoni and sausage. Their sausage is so unbelievably delicious.\n\nAlso be sure to get their mozerella cakes as an appetizer it will make you wonder why every one doesnt have them on their menu.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is that they have RC products instead of Coke or Pepsi."

All the out of towners said the pizza was the best they ever had. The staff were great and very attentive to all of our guests. I called ahead and placed the order of everything we wanted to serve. Once we all arrived, the staff brought out all of our food timely.  This made everything so easy and we got to spend time mingling with everyone.'

The service was very nice and the setting is casual. They don't have much on the menu other than pizza, a few pasta dishes and a few salads. Don't come here expecting a large variety of Italian food. It seems their specialty is pizza and that is what they do best."
