Tyler Schumacher, a day ago, 1, 'Waited over an hour for a delivery only for the pizza to be so cold it wasn‚Äôt safe to eat. Also was burnt and charred to begin with.

Rachel Rowan, 4 months ago, 4, 'I think they have the best chicken parm in town. We first ordered it as delivery, which was good and on time. So we went tonight to try their chicken parm in person and again it was delicious. We also got the bruschetta too and while each ingredient was fresh and delicious, it was a little hard to eat because the tomatoes were cut too large so they kept falling off the bread.\n\nDining in was great but a little weird in that they don‚Äôt serve drinks? We ordered water and got handed bottled water..? I asked if they had iced tea, but they were ‚Äúout of Snapple‚Äù ‚Äî not what I had in mind. For a place that clearly cares so much about their food being of the highest quality, I can‚Äôt figure out why they wouldn‚Äôt finish off the dining experience by actually offering drinks to go with their amazing food. Otherwise loved the atmosphere inside and the server was fine if not a bit disinterested.'

Meet Patel, 5 months ago, 5, "The plain pie made thin and crispy with their special garlic, pepper oil is absolutely some of the best pizza I've ever had! This was our first stop in a short pizza tour with friends and we unanimously agreed that it was the bes pizza we had that day! Ralph's in Nutley, NJ was a close second but the combination of garnish, flavor, crisp, and the added bonus of the oil made this place the clear winner! The pizza is definitely pricey at $25 for a pie but I think its worth treating yourself once in a while!"

If it\'s going to be an hour, tell me when I order it so I can either say "no thanks" or plan accordingly.\n\nLast night we decided to try eating at the restaurant, thinking that would avoid the long wait for takeout.  It still took about an hour.  This was because our waiter forgot to enter our ticket before leaving for the night.  Another attentive staff member noticed my wife and I slowly dying of hunger, put 2 and 2 together, and put our order in and apologized.  He didn\'t explain what happened though until I mentioned that I was confused that other tables sat down 15 minutes after us and got pizza before us.  Which is fine, it happens.  But there\'s a pattern.  And a well-run business would have compensated us in some way.  "Sorry the kitchen messed up, here\'s a dessert on us" for example.  That didn\'t happen.'

When I arrived I was told by an employee that my pizza separated and opened the box to show me. There was sauce all over the box, the crust was completely burnt, and the cheese had fallen off. I asked if I could have a new one and the employee spoke with the cook and showed him the pizza, and he responded by pushing the pizza back together and presenting to me what it was supposed to look like. I was expecting a yes when I asked for a new pizza since it cost $55 which is also just insane but #Hoboken and it's my birthday. At that point I just asked for my money back which they were nice enough to accommodate. This place was the best 3 or 4 years ago."

David Douglass, 11 months ago, 4, 'The Experience\n\nSince everyone had fled the NYC area for thanksgiving the cute outdoor seating was nicely empty. The heat lamps helped us pretend we weren‚Äôt eating outside in the winter and the BYOB policy allowed me to warm myself with copious amounts of red wine. The service wasn‚Äôt as good as the ambiance. We had to ask for utensils, ask twice for water, and there was a snafu with the bill.\n\nThe Accoutrements\n\nWe got the ‚Äúnaked meatballs‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt an 80‚Äôs adult film but rather a sauceless appetizer. Instead of marinara, you got a hot pepper and ricotta on the side. The meatballs had a rich meaty flavor that stood on their own without the sauce. The pepper and ricotta added a fun dynamic. The pepper left this lasting tingle on the tongue which you could cool down with the ricotta. Overall a more interesting take on the normal saucy meatballs.\n\nThe Main Course\n\nThe pizza is in their name and so it had to be good. We got a classic pie with mushrooms, pepperoni, and arugula. The stand out topping was the pepperoni. This was not your bargain been cheapo roni this was top tier rounds of red flavor. Speaking of red, the sauce tasted so fresh I started looking around for the garden they picked the tomatoes from. Grab a pie here and you won‚Äôt be disappointed.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nRealistically this is 3.5. The service was 3 stars if I‚Äôm being generous. However, the atmosphere and food were a 4-star situation. Since I‚Äôm a glass half full guy I‚Äôll round up to 4 stars. Your waiters might not be attentive but your taste buds will appreciate your patience.'
Thomas Connolly, 11 months ago, 2, 'When picking up a pie from there, they don‚Äôt give an estimated time to pick it up. Rather they say we‚Äôll text you when it‚Äôs ready.

Aliyah Huland El, 11 months ago, 1, 'I just was witness to absolute AWFUL customer service. A young man, who happened to be black/African-American, working for postmates walked in and was immediately accosted upon his arrival. When he communicated that he was there to place/pick up an order, the man in charge rudely and loudly told this young man he was not to place an order with him, so he shifted over to speak with a young woman at the register. When he began talking to her and showed his phone (my guess to show the order), the man then accused this young man of ‚Äútrespassing‚Äù and threatened to call the cops. It seemed so unwarranted, and quite random, as the young man was respectful and very clearly just doing his job. Kudos to the young man for handling the situation so well, and shame on the man working!! I will NOT be supporting this restaurant going forward.'

Matthew Horesta, a year ago, 3, "The original pie is as good as Dave Portnoy says it is and worth the $27 price. It really is a superior pizza pie. My service experience was a disappointment. After learning that my order was given to another person with the same first name (not a big deal, mistakes happen on a busy night), I waited another 40 minutes to get two pies. 40 minutes of standing of the curb while watching pies come out to table customers and take out is bad form. You make a mistake you should fix it ASAP. Upon getting home I find that one of the pies wasn't my original order. No acknowledgement of the inconvenience and I was still charged full price."

But that wasn‚Äôt our issue, after receiving our pizza my partner was in the midst of grabbing a slice and the waiter comes over and tells us ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt your pizza‚Äù and snatches the pizza right out of his hands. Instead of apologizing for his actions he denies his approach while smart mouthing which escalated the situation. Had he been honest and respectful the outcome would have been different.

It's expensive, $30 for a square pie I believe, but it's unlike any other pizza in the city.\n\nI'd recommend one square pie per 3 people. Haven't had any of the round pies in my multiple visits but the squares have never disappointed.\n\nNaked Meatballs were OUTSTANDING. From what i hear the pasta dishes are alright/good but can neither confirm nor deny. Typically I'll go with a group, bring wine (it's BYOB which is amazing), and order a couple square pies.\n\nNOTE: ask for the garlic oil to add atop your pizza and gladly accept the fresh parm shred over the top\n\nSomething else I love about Tenth Street is how they'll call you when your food is ready for pickup. Very unusual but I'm a fan."

Terry Ahn, a year ago, 1, 'Shame, great pizza. Horrible customer service. I ordered 2 sodas with my pizza, both arrived warm. I called them to ask if I can get a refund and that they can come back and get the sodas if they want. The manager told me it\'s "obvious" they would be warm because they never refrigerate their sodas, and I would know that if I ever ordered from them before. And I should\'ve asked for cold soda if I wanted it. Then she says I could easily put them in my fridge or use ice. Oh really? Is that how I make my drinks colder? Gee thanks. Not everyone has ice ready and I never had a pizza place deliver warm sodas before. They also forgot the garlic oil that comes with every pizza and I specifically asked for, and rudely told me that\'s a courtesy so I shouldn\'t complain about it. I\'ve delivered food before so I\'m not about to make their driver come back to my 4th floor apartment to get me a cup of oil so I just hung up on them. Btw, this is for a 46 dollar bill, for 1 large pizza and 2 warm sodas lol. If you\'re gonna charge 6 dollars per topping, at least have good customer service.'

We ordered at 6:10 pm, they told us it would be about an hour to an hour and a half. We show up to pick it up and pay.  Everything is normal, and then we watch order after order go out.

Although still dark, the pizza was not burned (maybe they should consider cooking a bit less, some pieces of crust were black, but not the entire pizza like last time). The flavor of the crush, sauce and cheese were well balanced, and far ahead of the rest of Hoboken\'s offerings. The bottom has that leopard print that marks a perfect texture. Overall, while I\'m still worried that it could come burned, I would order again. For each unburned order I will add another star to this review.\n\nPreviously:\nThe pizza came delivered completely burnt and inedible. Upon calling I was told "all of the pizzas come well done" and was completely disregarded. Poor quality food and poor quality service. The sauce and cheese were of good flavor. Too bad the crust was nearly incinerated.'

Otherwise, noodles were bland and flavorless. When you‚Äôre working with salt on multiple levels- from the pasta, boiled water, and Parmesan, it should have plenty of flavor. It seems as if they made up for that lack with the black pepper.\n\nIt‚Äôs a cute spot and will probably go back, just not for the Cacio e Pepe though.'
Eric Bell, 2 years ago, 5, "*edit 9/24/2019. I've come back 2 times now after my initial 1 star review and I'm happy to say that they reverted back to their initial quality. I can't taste the pre-baking of the dough and it's crisp and fresh again. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great tasting, slightly different (square) pizza.\n\nI use to love coming here and the square pizza was one of my favorites in Hoboken. That's until they started precooking all of the dough hours beforehand. This is absolutely indefensible. Just take a look back into the kitchen at the stack of cooked dough. I don't know a single pizza place that does this, let alone charge 30 dollars for it.\n\nThe result is that the dough on the finished pizza once it sat around all day then cooked again with the toppings, is that it's incredibly stale. The dough is both hard and soggy at the same time. After eating here multiple times, I won't be back until this process is changed."

Robert Lurie, 2 years ago, 5, "Easily one of the top 3 best pizza places in Hoboken, and given how many pizza places there are here, that's are hard list to compete on. Over the past few months, they've expanded their menu, which is a welcome addition as they started out with just 3 to 5 items.\n\nWhenever my wife and I are looking to order pizza, this is our go-to. For dine in, it's just as amazing. Such a cute atmosphere and it's BYOB! They use the freshest ingredients and the pizza is thin and crispy - so delicious. The square pizza really is incredible, some of the best I've had. Square pizza usually suffers from being too dough-y and dry, this is not the case.\n\nThe owners are also so friendly and really do care about their product. Highly recommend this place."

Mike Kerslake, 2 years ago, 5, 'I\'ve eaten a lot of pizza, from a lot of different locations in my life. It\'s quite possibly the most important thing in my life, next to family. That said. This place has made it to my top ten list, for sure. From the moment I came in, I knew I was going to fall in love because at the top of the menu it read "all pie\'s come well done". I came here on a date and we split a large Margherita pie. It was absolutely, exceptional. If I wasn\'t so keen on not looking like a slob, I would of ordered a second pie to take home for second dinner. They\'re BYOB so definitely bring yourself a nice bottle of wine or a 6 pack of something hoppy (if that\'s your jam). It\'s a bit small, but it\'s cozy. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. Definitely, definitely, definitely stop by this place.'

Evan Boyle, 2 years ago, 4, '10th Street opened up in our neighborhood and my wife & I have been meaning to go for months. We went for the first time tonight & will definitely be back. The food was spectacular and it can be argued that it has the best pizza in Hoboken (definitely gives Napoli‚Äôs and Johnny Pepperoni a run for their money). There‚Äôs 2 reasons I‚Äôm not giving it 5 stars: 1) The water situation is weird. It‚Äôs self-serve, so you have to get up for water everytime you want more. 2) It‚Äôs a bit pricey for a BYOB place. Other than that, this place is great & I highly recommend it.'
