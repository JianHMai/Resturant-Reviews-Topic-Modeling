From their specialty sandwiches (The Losurdo, The Fig & Pig) to a ‚Äúmake-your-own‚Äù sandwich, to their homemade sausages, bread, mutz and cannolis, everything is always stellar. Also love the selection of grocery items in the store. Those guys are the greatest.'

Ying Wang, 2 months ago, 5, "The sandwiches were really good. The service was amazing. I just wish the prices can be a bit more transparent. We ordered one with a full loaf of bread and a different one with half a loaf of bread, the total was $41. It was a lot of food but we almost didn't bring enough cash. I can't find prices listed anywhere, and other reviews don't seem to talk about prices either."

Mary Attaway, 6 months ago, 5, 'I had a pig and fig sandwich here that I think about maybe too much. Just perfect from the bread to the ingredient portions, which I sometimes feel like can be overdone in old school places in the spirit of giving ‚Äúmore‚Äù but then you end up with deli meat so sky high you can‚Äôt even take a bite. That was not the case - this was a truly perfect sandwich in every respect. Good customer service and entertaining environment. Will be back for more.'

Nick Lenzi, 7 months ago, 5, "Hands down my favorite place to grab a sandwich in Hoboken. They have daily specials that you can find on their Instagram but the day to go in my opinion is the weekends to grab Frankie's Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. The sauce on it is the best buffalo sauce I've ever tasted. Also it's a bakery so you can get some really great breads here too. Just expect it to take a bit to get in an out for some reason it always takes 20 minutes no matter how many people are in line."

Your mother sends you with a note and they already know what you‚Äôre going to get. It‚Äôs family owned and they‚Äôve kept up family tradition, a close knit family. Food is delicious, you have to try Ricotta pie and the canoli‚Äôs.

Kimberly Favara, a year ago, 5, 'These guys are the real deal. The BEST mutz in Hoboken. I know that\'s a bold assertion, but it\'s true. Everything is made fresh on premises including their bread. They make all the old school Italian specialities that you grew up eating for different holidays, my personal fave is the Pizza Rustica at Easter. Also their foccacia that they make on Saturdays is so good: light and airy not heavy at all. My advice get a baby foccacia as a sandwich! Better be there right when the foccacia comes out of the ovens at 11am otherwise you\'re going to have to fight all the Nonnas. Another bold statement: best cannolis in town. Yes, they are better than that "famous" baker in town. You pretty much can\'t go wrong at Losurdo\'s!'
