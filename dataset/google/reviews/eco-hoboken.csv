Andrea Gonzalez, 9 months ago, 1, 'I recently called this store to ask about their “puff bars”. They told me their price was $16 (which is completely overpriced, the usual price is $10). They then said that they sell 2 for $25. I then made my way over there. I bought 2 puff bars expecting to pay $25. When I got back home, I checked my transactions and they charged me $32. I called to tell them and they never answered. I then discovered that the puff bars were fake. This is unacceptable and unprofessional. I will be reporting to the Better Business Bureau.'

Nasser Al-Hanna, 2 years ago, 1, "Rude over priced, filthy and practice illegal ways to con and trick customers.  For being a neighborhood corner store, they don't he complete opposite of welcoming it's neighbors in.  They have no service and answer paying customers with lies and rude disrespectful answer.\nAsninket then know that I will be posting my bad experience of this store on Google, they shrugged it off snd didn't even care.  They are anti American but more importantly they are selfish and full of greed.  If you are left to shop somewhere else please do so.  Boycott them untill they fmfhsngr thier ways."
