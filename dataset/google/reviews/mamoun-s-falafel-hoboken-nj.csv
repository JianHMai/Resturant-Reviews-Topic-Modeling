I was completely shocked when I saw the other orders have led on their juices. I asked for the girl's name in order to mention her name in this review but the guy worker did not give me her name, and tries to justify for her in which means they support her lie. It would not cost the female worker anything to tell the truth and to cover it with led but it cost her the message that she wants me to get from her side. This place lacks professionalism and they play dumb with Muslim customers. Please Manager if you see my comment consider it really well because they do not have respect for customer's race and ethnicity. By your role and duty, you can stop this by stop hiring this kind of employee who lies for no reason for customers and play dumb with them."

I think it might be better to go when it's busier (so the surface of the meat hasn't been directly on the heat for so long), but I've also noticed that they give you less meat when it's busy (so that they don't have to wait so long to cut the next cooked portion for people)."

If you are ordering online for delivery like me, will recommend ordering any type of sauce on the side, so your food will not get soggy by the time it reaches you. Food was so appetizing, it made my day. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who is craving some  mediterranean food, and to those who want to try something new. Also if you are a sweet tooth, go and order all 3 available desserts on the menu, you will not be disappointed.  I loved perfectly balanced taste baba ghanouj, it made me rethink my stand on eggplants(I never liked them muchüòú). Pita bread that came along with the order was fresh and warm. I had pickled stuff add ons, but if you are not big fan of pickles or have duel mind about it avoid them, as they are extremely sour. My order was entirely vegetarian so, I am only vouching for veg food options, but based on taste amd quality of my food I assume other options must be equally well prepared. I love this place and is definitely part of my permanent list. Thanks for the food Mamoun's Falafel."
Mo Metwally, 9 months ago, 4, "Consistently good food here. Been going to the original location with my pop since I was a kid and to this location for decades as well. They have a nice rewards system in place but you need to mention it as they seem to forget to ask for your information at the end of the order. Falafel, lamb, and hummus rarely disappoint at Mamoun's. They finally sell their hot sauce by the bottle and if you like spicy but flavorful grab a bottle. Solid joint."

Jessica Aleksandra, 11 months ago, 4, "Always an immensely incredible dining experience overall with Mamoun's. You cannot go wrong with any Mamoun's chain. No matter where you go. Their ingredients are freshly prepared and cooked. Plenty of lettuce, onions, tomatoes, tahini white sauce, and their dreaded super spicy red chilli sauce to go around. Falafels are super crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Shwarma (lamb), beef, and chicken gyro or platter are excellent! Plenty of meat pieces and rice. Affordable prices and relatively decent portion sizes for the money. Parking-wise, you are in downtown Hoboken so the parking is a bit tough to find here and there. You may be lucky when the timing is just right when someone backs out of a parking space, and you grab it! Otherwise, street parking with meters. Nonetheless, overall, food and quality/taste are excellent!"

Jack Zakka, a year ago, 3, "I visited Hoboken location past Friday (7/24/20) with group of friends. We found couple types of sandwiches ran out (Shawerma, Shish Kebab), then, after we ordered couple sandwiches. All sandwiches had too much of white (tehini) sauce & was so light. So, it was spilling everywhere, made bread torn in pieces, spilling on our hands, arms, wears, shoes & floor where we're standing on the sidewalk!\nStore staff are already aware; that we're not dining in because of COVID-19 issue.  Also, we won't be able to use the bathroom to wash our hands & clean that mess on our wears. So, they have to consider that when they're making sandwiches."

I definitely do not recommend this restaurant the food is very stale and bland'

Purchased a chicken kabob over salad and shawarma sandwich over rice and waiting for the food to be prepared. Both meals were cold and taste stale. The meats were tough, and the food was absolutely tasteless. The salad didn‚Äôt taste fresh, It tasted as if it was sitting out all day and not refrigerated. However, the mint lemonade was pretty refreshing.\n\nI WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT to any real Mediterranean food lovers. For a quick bite, I recommend Gypsy Grill.'

When I called them to let them know, they wanted me to drive all the way back to Hoboken from JC to return a sandwich and a salad after spending $45 with them, this btw was the manager on the phone. WOW! I will take the loss but they will not be seeing my business again. It is unacceptable for businesses to have such an awful attitude. And I hope more people stand up to it."
