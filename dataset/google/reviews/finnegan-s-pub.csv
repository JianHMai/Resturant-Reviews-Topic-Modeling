Good God was I wrong when we went in on a Friday night to find club music, bodies dancing and drinks flowing. What a crazy surprise for us and we made a few friends to boot."

I wouldn't say that it's a craft beer-focused pub but they have enough interesting beer to keep me happy. I've been to a couple of birthday parties in the upstairs room which is a nice option too if you want to have a private event but don't have space (or don't want to torment your neighbors) at home."
