Carlos Titos, a week ago, 5, "Visited this place for the first time with my girlfriend after having a craving for cookies. Insomnia cookies is a thumbs up in every way possible. Cookies were very fresh, warm and extremely tasty. Would easily recommend the S'mores Deluxe Cookie, the Peanut Butter Chip Cookie and the Triple Chocolate Chunk. If you're looking for delicious cookies, this is definitely a great spot. Price is reasonable. On a crowded day you might have trouble maneuvering in the store, but just be patient. Staff is also friendly and chill. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Hoboken."

The Critical J, 2 months ago, 4, "PROS: Obviously the cookies are amazing here and the service is nice to you and fast. They keep the place clean and it's all reasonably priced too. Lastly, it's open till 3am which is the best time compared to other bakeries.\n\nCONS: It's out of the way of other bars so you have a nice little walk you have to go on in order to come across it. It's very tiny inside which doesn't allow that many people to eat in it.\n\nOVERALL: I recommend coming here as long as you're in the area and you want to eat on the go"

Melanie Tam, a year ago, 4, "*Quarantine Delivery Review*\n\nBack in the good old days when we were allowed to walk around at our leisure, I would always pass by Insomnia Cookies and it always smelled so good. Now fast forward to my fiance's quarantine birthday. I wanted to get a sweet treat for him so I thought of Insomnia Cookies. I had also tried them at a Yelp event in NYC once, so I knew they would be good. I placed an order for same day delivery and it came exactly when it said it would. We had the peanut butter chocolate, chocolate chunk, double chocolate chunk, snickerdoodle, sugar, and white macadamia nut. My favorites were the snickerdoodle and the white mac nut. The double chocolate chunk was too sweet for me but the sugar level on everything else was perfect. We ate some a few days later (after popping them in the toaster over), and it still tasted great. Next time, I'll be trying the funfetti!"

I haven't yet found the best time to go to avoid these mishaps, but they do their best by not over baking to avoid stale cookies. Which is fine I don't mind waiting for a fresh cookieü§§ü§§!\nThe only downside is they aren't on UberEats!!! I'd love to order cookies from my living room instead of traveling to HOBOKEN NJ.

He stated that they called the phone number listed and that there was no lights on in our apartment. I live in an apartment on ground level where I can see anyone walk by where I was seated next to the window (as we don't have a doorbell). No one walked by in that hour and forty minutes. Additionally there were no calls on my phone. So he lied. He said it would be delivered again and when I asked for a time estimate and he said idk it takes a while. ???

Let's make my first two experiences short and sweet. 1. Ordered over the phone and waited two hours before anything was ever received and had to call multiple times in order to even get it done. 2. Placed an order online and then proceeded to wait an hour again before I called and was told my order had not been processed but some how they still managed to charge my card, order was eventually sent out after waiting another hour. And last but not least! I place an order tonight at 12:30 over the phone (which always transfers you to there completely idiotic call center, instead of the store located in the city I live) and after being told I should wait no more than 30 minutes I call after an hour has passed, they tell me the delivery driver has just left and should be here shortly, so I wait another hour and it is now 2:30. Mind you, no call from the driver or store has been made to me, so I call customer service only for them to tell me it shows it has been delivered. They say I can take it up with a supervisor tomorrow and it's now 3am as I write this. Ha! Don't bother ordering from this establishment, they will either waste your time or steal your money. I'll be contacting my local police department tomorrow to see what I can do as far as getting my money back and pressing charges."
