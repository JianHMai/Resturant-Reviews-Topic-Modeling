Toxichammertoe, a month ago, 1, "I had there veggie bowl...They are stingy on portion size and not very tasty except there white rice........., It does come with Guac but it's a tiny portion...not worth the $10 plus tax...I had to hit up Chipotle after because I was still hungry. Unless you want to want a depressing episode of hunger frustration, DONT BOTHER WITH THERE VEGGY BOWL!!! IT'S BASUDA!!!"
Ryan Black, a month ago, 3, 'Consist but they constantly try to force a 30 cent bag on you. They don‚Äôt tell you that they charge for it, they assume you want a bag just to try to make some extra money. Also they will give you a small portion if they‚Äôre about to close. Manager is kinda rude'

followJTusa JT USA, 3 months ago, 3, "Updated July 6, 2021 The service here goes down when Eric is not on duty. One lady in charge tried to snatch back an extra fork I had in my hands as if I were a bad child and told me that I should get only one fork. I was sharing our usual order of Chicken Quesedilla with my husband. What is my opinion? The staff behaves as they see the owner behaving. Some of you know probably know what I mean.\n//////\nMy Prior review:\n(Hoboken.jan). We only go to the Hoboken branch. My take? Consistent, reliably good and mild Mexican flavors: chopped steaks; chicken; Fajita; ground vegan meat substitute either wrapped into a Burrito; presented as a Quesadilla; or as toppings on greens. Pico de Gallo,  Guacamole, sour cream, sweet corn, Green Bell peppers,  beans, rice, grated cheese all complete the flavors you prefer. We love the Chicken Quesadilla. It is our go-to hunger filler when we don't want to cook :-) The consistency of flavors deserve a five star, but the seats are just too cafeteria-like and are uncomfortable. People behind the counter are very efficient, quick, and polite. Eric is a friendly and courteous manager backed by good and attentive staff. Five star for the crew. I haven't seen the forks and spoons on display since the quarantine. If you feel like munching to release stress, try the Queso and Cheese. I usually add a tazita of sweet maize into the melted cheese for a more satisfying round of gnawing :-) There's more on the menu including soup and a selection for children. I could not remember music there lately. The rest of my family loves the steak while I really gor to like the vegan alternative."
