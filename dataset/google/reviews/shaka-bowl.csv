Melisa Fluhr, 2 months ago, 5, 'We catered a luau themed outdoor party for 30ppl this summer using Shaka Bowl which is was located 40 minutes away from our home and we were thrilled! We went with build your own and asked for the serving dishes to be included. It was so simple to set an elegant buffet with loads of toppings and sauces. Everything arrived carefully packaged and right on time by a Shaka Bowl Manager. Our guest were then served dumplings and egg rolls passed along with big portions of tacos before making their own poke bowls. Again, everything was fresh, colorful and tasty. The next day, the team came back to pick up their dishes and supplies. Big thanks to Kiersten and her team for the delicious food and for helping me host a such a memorable event!'

Athos, 3 months ago, 1, "I had such high hopes for this bowl of poke. I live in the Heights by the Congress St. elevator, and I have tried Tidal, Pokay and Piki, and each has its plusses and minuses, and all can be very good - but Shaka Bowl was in walking distance to me, so no driving and no expensive delivery fees either. I felt like I had just discovered something great! The first time I went there, they had no salmon at all, so I decided to wait for another time. That time was today. Easily the worst bowl of Poke I've had in the area, by a looooong mile.\n\nI got a large bowl and asked to pay for an extra scoop of fish - and make the whole bowl half tuna and half salmon. I picked my toppings and ponzu sauce. I didn't see spicy mayo on the menu so I didn't ask. I got my order then decided to ask for some spicy mayo on the side, figuring they must have it. The guy said it was not allowed. Turns out that sauce is called spicy shaka sauce, so you can order it, but apparently you can only get one sauce with your bowl. Every other place is not this stingy - you can get a shoyu for your bowl and top it with spicy mayo everywhere else. Whatever, I figured I'd go home and mix up some Kewpie mayo with some sriracha and mix it in to my bowl.\n\nI got home and did so, but the portions were insulting. I asked for extra fish for the money, and there was less fish on this bowl than any of the other three places I mentioned, even if get a regular order, let alone pay for extra. They were even stingy with the pineapple and edamame, which there was little of compared to what I am used to, and I couldn't taste a single sweet onion or cilantro. I tried to find them visually and I couldn't see them either. They forgot two of my toppings.\n\nEverything seemed fresh. But what's the point?"

The shape of the container that this was all SQUISHED in did not make it any better. It was a one big mush by the time I got to the bottom of it - definitely not a good experience. I will try other options In town they offer this type of a bowl. Needless to say after 3 bites I threw it out in the trash. The bananas were simply not edible.'

Absolutely pathetic.

Yeah that's nuts .fish the size of Penny's? Joke. Never gain will I come in here to throw away my money to these people. And on top of it all one of the two bowls was missing components....

Prices remained the same for the smaller bowls. For that reason, they get a 4 out of 5 from me.\nI still frequent Shaka, and appreciate the rewards program, friendly staff, atmosphere, cleanliness, and all, but those changes do not go unnoticed...'

Shaka Bowl offers acai, pitaya, parfait and poke bowls (snack or large size), so they were able to try something different. I had the zoodles in my poke, Nix had zoodles and rice with ahi tuna. Everything was delicious and the service was good. The only reason not 5 stars is because we all wanted mango in our bowls, but sadly no mango that day. Nix loved his smoothie afterwards and the coffee was delicious. We also took home monkey bread, which my girls have tried to recreate, because it was so tasty. Will definitely go back.'

The Acai Bowls will run you 10$.\n\nI also enjoy the Poke Bowls, I usually just build my own. You can mix and match greens with a base and general protein. Add some sweet and spicy sauce to give it a nice kick. Poke Bowls are a bit more expensive running you 14$.\n\nEven though this place is a bit expensive it is still much cheaper then NYC spots. Good luck with parking in the area. Also it is a small seating area. They need to expand to Jersey City."

Valentina Gu, 4 years ago, 4, "One of my favorite poke bowl places around! Really good poke bowls that many others just can't mimic. I gave 4 stars because the sauce has been heavy the past couple of bowls I've gotten. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
