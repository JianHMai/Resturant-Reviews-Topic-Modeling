Jessica Wang, 2 weeks ago, 2, 'I gave this place a 4-star review when it first opened. We were glad to have a place nearby to order good dim sum. We had since ordered from here many times.\n\nBut our recent experience had not been good.\n\nA couple of weeks ago when I got home with my takeout order, two of the dishes were not what I ordered.\n\nFor my most recent order over the phone, I was given an ETA of ~25 minutes. When I got there 30 minutes later, I was told it was not ready yet. I knew ETA was not meant to be exact, so I paid and waited inside. 20 minutes later, I inquired on my order again and was only told then that their chef was out and just got back. He could now start working on my order. I decided to have my money back and left.\n\nI wish the guy who took my order and watched me wait had the courtesy to inform me of the real situation earlier. Instead, they just lost a customer for good.'

carl chwiej, a month ago, 5, 'Best dim sum for miles.  You will love it!'
Dan H, a month ago, 1, "Decent dim sum option, but pricing on delivery services are highly predatory. For example, several item that are priced $14.95 on their menu is somehow $19.50 on UberEats. This is before taxes and fees. I believe the store sets the price. So ordering 2 such items will add a premium of close to $15 with taxes and fees, even before delivery fee and tip.\n\nNote to owner - come on, I realize that serving on delivery apps costs money but you can't just pass all the fees back to the customer, the prices are so unrealistic! Paying the platform is just the cost of doing business!"
Calvin Kwon, a month ago, 5, 'All the food seems fresh and delicious. Would definitely order again. We got fried dumplings, XLB, and beef chow fun. Highly recommend the beef chow fun'
Qiao Jiang, a month ago, 1, 'Made an online order. It took one hour to get my food. This is absurd as a dim sum restaurant. I would have picked any dim sum order from Fort Lee. Not worth it.'
Sikang Hu, a month ago, 1, 'I made an order online, and they told me to wait 25-40min. However, I actually waited more than one hour. I came to the restaurant and waited there for more than 40 minutes. It is really a terrible experience. Also, It is really hard to find a parking spot near Washington St.'

Wei Wang, a month ago, 5, 'Even though this might be the only dim sum place you can find in hoboken,  but it‚Äôs super authentic that it might be even better than some of the places in Chinatown. MUST TRY!!!!'
Andy Chen, a month ago, 5, 'fresh and tasty, really authentic dim sum'
Shweta Kamat, 2 months ago, 5, 'Excellent food. We tried their house pork dumplings, bean curd skin with shrimp, rice and mushroom in lotus leaf, Chinese sausage fried rice, salt n pepper squid. Every dish tasted so good. Will definitely try more dimsum from here. Great addition to Hoboken.'
Liza Gomelski, 2 months ago, 5, 'Super enjoyable. Got to try several dishes at an affordable price, not everything was for me but that‚Äôs the beauty of places like this. You can keep coming back and trying out a new dish.\n\nThe server was lovely.\n\nExcited to come back!'

Lisa Wy, 5 months ago, 5, 'What attracts me is that the dim sum tastes great'
Janina Pirela, 5 months ago, 2, 'Food was very greasy. The beef short rib and pork short rib was extremely fatty and had little to no flavor. Pork one looked a bit sketch, didn‚Äôt eat more than one bite. The crispy pork and shrimp dumplings were greasy and the dumpling itself was extremely thick and chewy, hardly any filling. Shrimp Shu Mai and pork soup dumpling were alright.'
Karen Wang, 5 months ago, 5, 'Popped in to order a handful of items off the dim sum menu and it was ready in 15 minutes (3 laps around the block). HIGHLY recommend the shrimp dumplings, shumai, and steamed pork buns. It‚Äôs about time Hoboken got an authentic dim sum place! I can‚Äôt wait to try more stuff off the menu.'

Jiaren Li, 6 months ago, 5, 'Overall, this was a good dim sum food place you can get in the Hoboken area. We ordered a bunch of dim sum dishes and they were all tasty and fairly authentic. Staff there were also very friendly and accommodating. As a new establishment it seems like still getting setup, but still worth a visit for a quick bite.\nHave to come back again for their entree and tea another day. Wait time is a bit long depends on when you go and it is pricy compare to Chinatown. It is also not the cart experience you get traditionally. but I would still frequent here for the food.'
