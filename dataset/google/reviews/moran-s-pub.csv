Eric Hammer, a year ago, 5, "Best burger in Hoboken.\n\nMy introduction to Moran's, dating back to September 2018, was the famous Moran's Burger with sweet potato wedges. I'll admit that it was a little much for me. Really good burger no doubt but between the irish bacon, truffle butter, and crispy onions, it was a bit of sensory overload. Didn't love the wedges, but gave em a shot because I typically love sweet potato fries.\n\nI've been back 5 or 6 times since I think, and I've elected for the BYO Burger. It's the best burger I've had in Hoboken and one of the better I've ever had. Bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, sometimes avocado, medium or medium rare depending on the day. It's a BIG burger with a generous portion of outstanding fries.\n\nIf I had one complaint about the burger it would be that the bun is sometimes a little bready. But that's a nitpick.\n\nMoran's is a MUST TRY if you want a burger in Hoboken. They have a sign outside that says Best Burger in Hoboken, and I'm here to say it's a bonafide fact."
Jeremy Vega, a year ago, 5, 'Awesome place for food and drinks and possibly one of the best burgers out there hands down.'
Brian Pearson, a year ago, 5, 'Great local joint with consistently high quality food, drinks, and reliable service. Lenny, the owner, is a rock star. More places in town should follow his lead and run an establishment the way he does. It really makes a difference. Not to mention - side note - my girlfriend calls him ‚ÄúLenny Soda Bread‚Äù because when this Irishman wears tight pants there‚Äôs a visible outline of his package that resembles a loaf of Bread as thick as a Soda Can. Geez is this guy packing . .\nAnyway, great spot - the Maple Bacon Chicken sandwich is a favorite. Two thumbs up !'
