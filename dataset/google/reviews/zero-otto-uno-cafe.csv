Cyr & Associates, 2 months ago, 5, 'I‚Äôve been here a few times now and I‚Äôm impressed. One of the better Hoboken Italian spots. It‚Äôs authentic, fresh ingredients, and clean.\n\nI would recommend the seafood fried platter to begin. Calamari, shrimp, and peppers. I only have one gripe, no tentacles but hey still amazing and plentiful. I‚Äôve had similar starters at many other area restaurants and theirs is ‚Äúthe best.‚Äù\n\nFor entrees, their pasta dishes or the Branzino are also quite good. We‚Äôve had the fusilli with shrimp in a cream sauce. You will not be disappointed.\n\nThey are BYOB, liquor store on next block is a hop. Just a nice relaxing meal with beautifully presented plates and service.'

We asked for a small side of pasta for our 20 month old son. Gave us a full size entree portion of pasta instead and charged us $12 for it. They charge extra for using a credit card which nudges people to use cash instead. Not ideal when we are in the midst of a  pandemic. Didn‚Äôt give us the correct change at the end. Bill was 71.24 and we payed $100 in cash. We were only given $24. We didn‚Äôt realize until we were few blocks away and we decided to just let it go. We are not going back.'

We were going to order a dessert after our meal but instead they brought us the check and kicked us out as they needed our table (btw the people they were accommodating had come in halfway during our meal to make a reservation‚Äîso they promised them our table). I see, in the reviews I‚Äôm not the only one this has happened to. We were rushed, and not even checked in on during the meal to see if everything was okay. Also, the pizza came out much later than the pasta. It seemed like they forgot about it. And also, after the appetizer, the server placed our utensils on the bare table, which I find gross (especially during flu season). Will NOT be returning.'

Andrea R., a year ago, 3, "Came here on a Friday night date at 7 pm. There is no hostess stand when you walk in so we stood in the doorway for a minute or two but then more people started piling in so we went to the back to inquire about our table. When we told a waitress near a computer that we had a reservation, she gave us a frightened look before a waiter called to us from the middle of the restaurant asking what we wanted. Whatever. He seated us and walked away.\n\nWe sat down (to a very crooked table and chairs) and were approximately 6 inches from the table next to us. We then realized the placed was BYOB. This is a plus for me and luckily a liquor store was down the street. Came back and the table as crammed full of giant menus, plates, glasses and bread.\n\nI had no clue who our waiter was at this point since no one came to our table so I asked the waitress to open our wine. She again looked terrified and opened it for us, didn't pour it into the glasses, and practically ran away. Then the waiter who seated us came back and asked if we were ready to order, which we weren't seeing as we were seated for 5 minutes. He came back 2 minutes later and asked again. I asked if the truffle pasta was dairy-free and he said yes. It wasn't. I should mention that we came for the squid ink pasta as it is on the menu online but it wasn't on the menu in the restaurant.\n\nThe saving grace was the food. The pasta with truffles and mushrooms was delicious. The pasta clumped together a bit but the sauce was great and the mushrooms were cooked well. My date ordered the Fiama pizza and really liked it. The pizza was big for one person which was ideal for him while the pasta portion was moderate. A little small for $25 but it was good.\n\nOverall, 3 stars. The place is small, dark and loud and the staff is terrible but the food is great. I would just order takeout next time."
Andrew Price, a year ago, 3, "Regina Margherita pizza was awesome - best pizza in Hoboken. Meatballs were decent (but not worth $18 as an appetizer.) Truffle fries were plain.\n\nThe space is nice, but it's so loud and noisy. We had to make a reservation for Saturday dinner."

Daniel McCarthy, a year ago, 1, "I would do zero stars if I could. The waiter was incredibly rude to us. We went at 530 on a Friday night with 7 people. We ordered a bunch of apps and planned on splitting pizzas, our plan was one pizza per 2 people and the waiter would not allow that. He insisted we had one entre or pizza per person, which was outrageous based upon how many apps we ordered. The waiter also rolled his eyes when we asked him to push tables together to accommodate our party. We purposely went early so we wouldn't have to wait, and the restaurant was completely empty. I have been to this restaurant many times, and I was not expecting this horrible service, I will never be coming back to this restaurant and I would tell everyone I know to go to one of the thousand other Italian restaurants in Hoboken, not this dump!!!

I have never had a rude waiter that forced us out of the restaurant and would not recommend eating here.

Matt Meyer, 2 years ago, 3, 'Restaurant is very nice decor and atmosphere. Staff is very quick to sit you down, take order and rush you out so they can flip the table. Requested well done pizza, came out chewy. Requested meatballs to come with pasta, came out alone before pasta. Tasted great but no need to rush out a dish when we ask for it with our main course. Pasta came out raw. Not al dente, but I could actually taste the hard shell crack in my teeth. On a cold, rainy and slow Thursday night, there were 7 full tables crammed on one side of restaurant while the vacant 7 tables on the other side of restaurant were saved for potential walk-ins. I was able to hear every conversation with the table to the left and right of me, almost close enough to touch elbows.  Used to enjoy the food but they seem like they are trying to squeeze out as many tables as possible as quickly as possible - no need to feel rushed during my meal.'

Melanie Tam, 2 years ago, 3, "Came in with a reservation for four on a Friday at 6:15. We didn't want a huge meal so we just ordered a bunch of things to share. We started off with the Cuoppo Fritto (fried calamari, shrimp, cod fish, served with tomato sauce) which was meh. Nothing special about it. There was much shrimp or fish - it was 90% calamari. Next, we had the Genovese pizza (bufala mozzarella, sweet sausage, homemade basil pesto), which I really liked. The crust was thin and they didn't skimp on the toppings. I was under the impression that the tomato sauce would be swapped out for pesto, but it was still the tomato sauce base, with dabs of pesto, which I didn't mind. We also ordered the Pappardelle (black truffle and porcini mushrooms) and some kind of seafood pasta that had shrimp, squid, octopus, and mussels, to share. I loved the pappardelle and the huge mushroom flavor. But the seafood pasta missed the mark. The seafood was a bit fishy and the the pasta was a little undercooked.\n\nI came back two weeks later and tried one of their calzones, which was not memorable. So far, it seems the general theme is that half of the items are good and half are meh. It's a hit or a miss. I'd still come back for the pappardelle and the pizza though.\n\nTip - BYOB"

Giselle Montalbano, 2 years ago, 1, "My boyfriend and I went for the first time to Zero Otto Uno Cafe today in Hoboken for our anniversary and we had a very unpleasant experience with the chef. I ordered a pasta dish with clams and when I received the dish, the food was cold and most importantly the clams were not good, tasted bad and were full of sands. I kindly explained the waiter the situation who took the clams away from the dish and suggested they will send me new clams while my pasta dish was sitting on my table getting cold, with no clams in it. I asked I would prefer to order a pizza instead since my food was going to get cold and with no clams on it. When we asked for the check we noticed they charged us for the dish I didn't even eat. I asked for a manager and the chef came out with an unpleasant attitude saying that the clams were good and, since he cooked it, I had to pay for it. I explained to him how sandy and old the clams tasted. He ignored me by saying that he did not care about my opinion, whether that I liked it or not. Once again he said: I cooked it and I liked it, so you pay for it.... It was embarrassing and disgraceful how the chef at this restaurant treats his customers and verbally embarrass them. Not only the food was not good but the worse part of whole experience was to witness how a chef can have such an disrespectful attitude towards his customers."

Greg Miller, 3 years ago, 5, "Great new place in town. We came in and just asked them to throw food at us, and they didn't disappoint. Great Italian food with good people."
Joseph Hoelle, 3 years ago, 5, 'Great TRUE ITALIAN food! Margarita pizza was good, 12‚Äù pizza. Ravioli was unreal, very cheesy and filling. Chef had us try some fresh meatballs and they were fantastic, made me wish I had gotten them. Platting was great. Bread comes with the meal. Waiter was attentive.\n\nCozy setting. Low lighting makes for quiet dining. Very ch√≠c.\n\nOverall great experience, everyone should check this place out!'

Ryan Kelly, 3 years ago, 5, "The pizza here is absolutely incredible. My wife and I came here after hearing it opened and fell in love with this place. We had the bucatini and bufala mozzarella pizza and would strongly recommend both dishes! It's also BYOB so feel free to bring a bottle of wine."
Diana Ceccarini, 3 years ago, 5, 'This place is great! Finally a Neapolitan pizza place opens in hoboken. If you like Porta‚Äôs pizza in hoboken you‚Äôll like this! Great job, welcome to the neighborhood! Plus its BYOB!'
