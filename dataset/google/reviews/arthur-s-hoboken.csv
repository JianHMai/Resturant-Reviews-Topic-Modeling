The steak was good they cut back on a lot of stuff was VERY disappointed 😞 $46.00 you should still get a full portion of potatoes 🥔 and a pepper 🌶 didn't even have one my bill was $400.00 in some change drinks were terrible. Its just not the same and I've been coming to Arthur's for a long time $12.95 steaks. Still love the steaks. PS. COVID has really messed up a lot of things!! 😢😢😡😡"

Sasha and the cats, 5 months ago, 3, "So I read all of the recent reviews.  I noticed that either people love or hate this place.  I admit I am a customer from over 15 years ago, and I loved this place.  Despite the recent negative reviews I decided to give them a try again.  Honestly I won't be coming back.  To be fair it's not because Arthur's is horrible or 1 star like some people have rated them.  It's because there are simply better places to go now that offer better food at a better value.  To be honest, you are better off going to Outback steakhouse.  You will get a better steak, choice, price and value, and better service.\n\nArthurs trimmed down there menu, it is 2 steak choices and I think a burger.  If you come here it's for steak.  The steak is large and a ribeye.  The steak was salty which I have never experienced before.  Not sure how they did that, salted butter or salt seasoning?  Way to salty, and I like salt.  Garlic bread was good, potatoes good, crab cake was tasty, service was adequate, but we noticed our neighbors waitress wasn't to friendly.  Overall, 2 people, 2 steaks, 3 drinks garlic bread, crab cake, $150 bill.  For that price like I said, go to outback, get a better steak, better sides, soup, appetizer, etc, cheaper bill.  Sad cause I used to love this place.  It's not 1 star, but not worth the trip or price."

milly ventura, 6 months ago, 2, 'Steak and potatoes not as good as I remembered in the past years. Priced at $44.00 not exactly reasonable and only one choice on the steak very disappointing! Potatoes were edible. The Salmon was undercooked had to send it back and the wedge salad which is usually one of my favorites at the finer steak restaurants was way overpriced for a piece of lettuce covered in some generic blue cheese sauce at 17.00! Waitress was great though they were obviously stressed out and trying to keep a positive attitude. Overall not a great dining experience. I took my niece for her birthday and I was embarrassed to even suggest it.'

The food was decent for the price BUT what made the experience 5 star is only because of the service. Our server Alexa was marvelous. She made our night. We didnt need to look for her. She was always there. She knows when to come back and check on us. I dont know this lady but we had to ask for her name, just only for this reason. To give her respect and Thank you...'

Definitely something to take home and make a stew the next day.\nI still think the lunch menu is a great deal!\nWhere in the NYC area can you get a high quality steak for under $37 these days?\nThe same steaks sell in fine dining Steakhouses for $50-60!\n\nIt\'s really hard to tell the difference between these top steakhouses and Arthur\'s because they get very similar "if not" the same quality cut!'

Not quite as memorable as the Arthur's of 25 years ago, but nothing is, these days.  Worth a visit, especially if craving a big slab of beef while in the area."

jenny nieves, 2 years ago, 2, "Not going back....I been going to this place for many many years. My husband decided to treat himself for a steak for his ( BD). He order the a medium steak and received and medium rare steak.😫 I order the two crabcakes with a side of corn salsa and asparagus. For almost $25 i thought i would be served two decent size crabcakes a nice portion of the corn salsa and asparagus. Instead the corn was scatter around my plates as garnished with two stalks of asparagus. I thought it was a bad joke....seriously charging me that price for two small capcake so return the dish. The waitress was very pleasant and offer me something else from the menu. I decided to go with the salad and told her i didn't want the blue cheese. She asked me if i wanted to swap for another cheese like fresh mozzarella. I asked her if it was an extra charge. She responded no because it was a swap of just cheese. When we got the bill we notice the xtra charge for the cheese. My husband approached the  manager and told her about the conversation i had with the waitress about the no extra charge but she responded that they don't do those kind of swaps. The manager seemed very bother and upset and took the xtra charged off. Time to look for another steak house!!"

Jess, 2 years ago, 5, "I've been to a ton of steakhouses and Arthur's had always been my favorite. If you go there, I highly recommend getting the Arthur's (our) steak. Perfectly grilled and delicious potatoes come with it. I've never sat upfront but I always sit in the back. The complaint I have is the chairs feel so old. Like, If you move it feels like they will collapse. It makes sitting there for an extended period uncomfortable. Besides that though, great food and good service."

lauren d, 2 years ago, 1, 'Review copied from my yelp\n\nTHIS PLACE HAS MICE. AND NOW THEY ARE IGNORING ME.\nFirstly, let me say that my name is Matt and I am posting on my gfs account bc I don’t have a yelp account, so if the restaurant reads this they can’t say that they never dealt with me bc it’s posted under a women’s name.\n\nI’ve been so patient in dealing with this place. This incident happened on Feb 13 and I’ve been dealing with this since that night..until now that I’ve been completely ignored by management. Now, I am not only disgusted with the issue itself but also with the way this issue has been neglected.\n\nI Came here with a friend to celebrate a work promotion, I’m so embarrassed I suggested this place to him as he had never been here before and I raved about the food. I’ve been coming here for years and years with family, friends, my fiancé, etc. I’ve never had a bad meal or had any issue before.\n\nWe had just finished eating and paid the bill, the check was still sitting on the table. Something caught my eye running between the tables. There were mice. I actually didn’t believe it at first so got up from my table and shined the light of my phone into the corner and there they were. I sat back down so grossed out that I just ate dinner and saw this. As the waitress passed by to see if we were taking out leftovers home I explained what I saw. She was not shocked at all. She offered to get a manager to come over to speak to us. Alexa was acting manager this night, she came over, offered us a drink on the house and a gift card for a future meal... I had just seen mice in and around the bar area and running between table, I’m not drinking or eating anything in its vicinity. Alexa flat out told us they aware of the issue "They come in from outside" she said... Well obviously you’re not ordering them in from your meat distributor. She offered to have Dave call me when he was in the next day which he did. I was at work and couldn’t get to the phone fast enough, missed the call. I called back later that day. Someone answered, I asked for Dave. They said hold on. Then came back to the phone and asked who I was. Once I said it was Matt they told me he isn’t here now. That was my first red flag. Why put me on hold to go get Dave but then when I say whose on the phone Dave suddenly isn’t there?? That was my first red flag that was being ignored.\n\nI’ve since called back a handful of times. I’ve been dealing with Vera now, who insists that she’s been emailing the guy who does the credit card transactions to get me a refund... this has been ongoing for what will be exactly a month tomorrow with no resolve in sight.\n\nThe way they were so nonchalant when we told there were mice was running by the tables and bar should have been an indication as to how the rest of the story would go. NEVER in all the years I’ve been coming here did I think this restaurant would be the kind of establishment to ignore a patron and make no attempt to right their wrong.  If you know you have a problem how do you not get an exterminator to come in as often as you need to so you can ensure this stops. If vermin is comfortable hanging out in the dining room I cant imagine what\'s going on in the kitchen. I’ve been letting this go on for a month, hoping it would be resolved privately. I’m sure my review will get me nowhere with them now, but this place is being reported to the health department....NEVER AGAIN.'
