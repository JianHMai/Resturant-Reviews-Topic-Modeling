Eleni Stavroulakis Meininger, 38 minutes ago, 3, 'Average experience. We had a party in the private room. Nice atmosphere, but the lights were very dim. The restroom lights were dim also, which is a bad sign as far as cleanliness goes. Drink service was good, food service was slow. Food was ok, although my crabcake and poached eggs were missing the crabcake, and instead I got an overly toasted and stale English muffin, so minus two stars.'
Probal DasGupta, 17 hours ago, 5, 'Good food. Great service. Excellent location right on the Hudson. It had become a favorite place for a social lunch event for some of us. We typically occupy the high table at the right hand corner just by the full glass wall overlooking the Hudson. Also very easy parking all around and in the garage right across the restaurant. Totally recommended.'
Danny Severino, 2 days ago, 1, 'The steaks are average at best. $55 for an 8 ounce filet is absolutely ridiculous. $32 for one glass of their house Pinot noir as well. I only saw our waiter 2 times and couldn‚Äôt even get a fork when I asked for one. There are many better options than this place in Hoboken.'

I had a great time the food was good and our waitress was nice, attentive & hospitable. Right outside the restaurant they have a cute little park/ lookout area with a nice view of NYC skyline. overall, I did enjoy myself. They even gave me a cute little dessert at the end with a candle for my birthday.\n\nMy only downfall for that night was that I left my brand new AirPods that I received as a birthday gift that night at the restaurant right by my seat. I tried calling that night but no response so I called the next day around their open time and was told no one found it. That was bitter sweet for me because I had such a good time, just for it to be ruined by losing such my birthday gift. A pricey one at that.'

Nia Daye, a month ago, 4, "Been to a Del Frisco's before (in Philly), but this was my first time at this location in Hoboken. Went for a private brunch party for my best friend's 30th. I got there a little later, but we all a good dining experience.\n\nShe did a pre-fixed menu to make things easier since there were at least 20 of us. I ordered the Chicken & Waffles entree without the bacon (they gave me that option), and many other people in our group ordered that as well. We all enjoyed it and felt the dish was very tasty, with the waffle having a nice crisp to it. I also had a piece of the Cinnamon Rolls since someone sit near me shared and, as someone who doesn't usually eat cinnamon buns, it was pretty good! It was very rich in taste and warm. We also ordered a number of drinks throughout the brunch. I had a couple of Mimosas, the Margarita and Manhattan cocktails on the menu - all made well and tasted just right.\n\nIf looking for a nice brunch or dinner for a special occasion (small or large), I would recommend them."
D Michael, a month ago, 1, 'So amazingly bad, the worst possible experience of any semi fine restaurant I have ever eaten. To be fair the appetizer course was good across the board very good. My drinks (old fashioned and margarita) were terrible. My medium ribeye came out as a strip and as I waited forever to get it corrected it got cold and when it went back to the kitchen it was turned around and sent back out with every assurance it was a ribeye.\nOver all this was the saddest experience, I only wish I had time to write about the experience.\nSo to conclude I‚Äôd rather eat glass than return to this restaurant.'
MR Bellio (Thumper), a month ago, 1, 'SO sad... I waited for a long time to eat at this place. It was horrible. Waiter was a absolute slob and his service was some of the worst I\'ve had. We rarely got refills, orders were wrong and to be completely honest the food wasn\'t worth the price. Dessert was the most depressing- I tried the Lemon cake they are "famous" for- I think it was just leftover cake from a Betty Crocker instant cake mix. This restaurant was SO BAD- I won\'t even give them a second chance. I mean- 600$ bill and waiter was untucked, foul mouthed and poor hygiene-'
Jason Sajdak, a month ago, 1, 'Absolutely. 100%. Certified. Terrible. From parking to wait staff.  No parking.  Table was placed in an area where we couldnt talk across the table, asked the manager about it as i have slight hearing loss, his response was "I just wont talk to you then".  Food was highly mediocre at best, online menu isn\'t updated to the current availability.  Water is not refillable unless its been a 1/2 hour.  Tried to pass off NY strip as ribeye. Rude and inconsiderate. Took 25 minutes to cash out.'

Ash Kat, a month ago, 1, 'We had the worst experience tonight for a birthday celebration.(No birthday song) From the moment we walked in we were treated poorly. Now I understand the rule of having to wait until majority of the party arrives however parking is terrible. The place was not crowded so it should have been no reason not to seat us. The manager for the night was rude from the jump. Our waiter was nice and did all he could. We had a issue with some of the entrees and the waiter tried to rectify but the kitchen was closed but we was never notified of this. The manager came come over and asked what was going on and when we advised he stated ‚Äúlike it told you the kitchen closed at 10‚Äù but he never told any of us this. He then proceeded to say was there anything else and didn‚Äôt even attempt to fix what was wrong. I was really appalled by this treatment and I told him it was no need for that type of treatment. He then walked away. Apparently made changes to the bill but that did not suffice for how we were treated. This place came highly recommended but I will never patronize this place again!! The manager made this the worst experience ever!! Need to learn how to provide better customer service.'

Something about the beef just tasted so average it was like I ordered a big mac from a McDonald's instead of a high end restaurant. Couldn't even finish it.  At least a big mac actually tastes good.\n\nThe service was also nonexistent. The waiter didn't even introduce himself. Came once to get our drink orders and once more for food. That was it. Like seriously? For a 3 dollar sign restaurant I expected much better.\n\nThe fries were the one redeeming thing about the whole experience, but it wasn't enough to offset everything else. DON'T ORDER THE BEEF HERE IT'S TERRIBLE.\n\nThe only reason I would come back would be to try their tuna tacos and Asian tuna salad.

Ryan, 3 months ago, 1, 'Middle of the summer and it‚Äôs not much cooler inside than it is outside. Really starts the experience off with the wrong impression. Our server was not interested in the service she was providing, at all, at any point during our visit. Our food was delivered, 9 minutes later she arrived to ask if everything was ok - we both asked for refills, and received them 16 minutes later. Maybe that‚Äôs nitpicky, but our food was done and we requested the bill. Again, 15 minutes to get the bill.\n\nThis only leaves the food as a last leg for this place to stand on as the environment and service are pathetic at best. To call the food mediocre would be a stretch compliment for the presentation and quality. I‚Äôm not sure what anyone is getting here or experiencing that they‚Äôd give this place 4+ stars, but that just wasn‚Äôt our experience from any angle.\n\nI don‚Äôt care to hear some generic apology from the restaurant because there‚Äôs absolutely no way we will ever return.

They also only include one price on their cocktail menu for $10, which gives me the impression that their drinks range from $10-15. However, my cocktail ended up being around $20. I really don't mind spending money on good drinks, but it felt purposefully misleading and contributed to the overall meh experience. Service was good though!"
