Somanath Tripathy, a day ago, 3, 'This would be easily 4 stars because the food ordered (Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Kali Mirch, and Chicken Biryani) and the time of delivery were great. What sucked is the free dal they give along with the food and rice. The dal smelled pungent and my friends and I failed to understand how a dal can be so bad. Either it was very poor quality lentils or some weird spice, and tasted way different from any other Indian dal. The restaurant will be better off removing the free dal and reducing the price of the entrees slightly instead.'

saroj lenka, 3 weeks ago, 2, 'Starts with one line "it\'s a spoiler"\n\nNot sure how folks reviewed and flgiven it 5 stars even. Tried with paneer tikka, veg biryani and chicken biryani. First of all surprised to see wierd and unusual starters menu for vegetarian like pakoras, chats although non-vegetarian was ok. When asked they were okntpbgive paneer tikka, so I had the worst tikka for first time in Karma cafe. It wasn\'t tandoor cooked but flamed. Only paneer covering was charcoaled and flavored while inside its raw paneer taste. Then coming to biryani, it smells good but they were like pulao, not biryani styled procedure. Also a bad smell was coming off the rice or something which is more of a old stock of rice or oil smells like rancid.. Absolutely shocked to feel amazed after tasting these nonsense. May be other things are good, but not for me at least.'

William Hayes, a month ago, 5, "Karma kafe is a intimate dining spot specializing in Northern Indian cuisine.\nLocated on Washington Street in Hoboken, it offers a varied selection of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian entrees.  The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining. There's a full bar available with a complete lineup of all types and levels of spirits.\n\nMy dining experience began with an excellent assortment of appetizers to choose from. I've recently ordered the Kabob sampler..an assortment of chicken and lamb kabobs.  There's the baked wings which were delicious and juicy. These are prepared in a delectable sauce. The Karma Aloo is a vegetarian dish made with potatoes that was excellent.  Also on the menu are the Vegetarian or Chicken Pakoras, very tasty and well prepared.\n\nThe Ginger Conconut Chicken is a must order.  This soup will be one of the best tasting soups you will ever have...ever!\n\nI recently ordered the Tandoori Chicken.\nThis is a full half chicken baked in the tandoor.  An absolutely superb meal...\ntender and juicy... prepared with just enough spices... and cooked to perfection.\n\nAlso, the Chicken Makhani or Butter Chicken is simply the most delicious dish one could order. Dark chicken pieces cooked in a butter tomato sauce..absolutely to die for.\n\nNot to be missed is the Shrimp Malabar.\nJumbo shrimp cooked in a Conconut sauce served with rice.  It doesn't get any better.\n\nIf hot and spicy is what excites your palette its the Chicken Vindaloo to order.\nChicken and potatoes in a very fiery sauce. A Goan specialty.\n\nI always order Naan bread.\nThis delicious bread complements any of the choices and comes in a variety of selections: plain, onion, garlic, onion or cheese.\n\nA great beverage choice is a mango Lassi. Its sort of a smoothie which can be ordered with or without alcohol.\n\nKheer or traditional rice pudding is a great end of dinner dessert.\n\nThe staff is well versed in the menu and the preparation of all offerings.  They are friendly and professional.  A number of the staff have been with KK for over 10 years.\n\nIf you crave really delicious and well prepared and presented Indian food this is the place to get yourself over to.\n\nI will say that ..due to each dish being made-to-order....be prepared to enjoy the evening leisurely..nothing is rushed!"

It was a fine Sunday afternoon meeting with a couple of friends from school after a long time and food was important to keep the reunion alive and happening. So we chose this place, Karma cafe to meet. Starting with appetizers we ordered vegetable kebab and karma aloo. Both were delicious, specially loved the karma aloo. With the drinks we ordered sparkling wine, both white and red. It was perfect. In the main course we ordered malai kofta and bread platters. It was good but hoping for a better taste. Overall, the presentation and service was nice. Looking forward to try again other appetizers. Thank you for the good food.'

Kordian Witek, 4 months ago, 5, 'Best long time Indian restaurant in Hoboken and downtown Jersey City area'
Bhumi Patel, 4 months ago, 1, 'Horrible service. Probably the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant. I called ahead of time and was told that “while we can’t guarantee a table because we don’t take reservations, if you come in the next 30 mins we’ll try our best to hold a table for you.” Show up in the heat and sun and are immediately told you’re going to have to wait ANOTHER 30 mins instead of offering an 85 yr old man and 80 yr old woman the option to at least sit inside at an empty table while they wait. I go inside to ask what happened and the waiter gave me so much attitude telling me that it’s my fault I showed up expecting a table and that I should have some respect and not cause a scene. After 20 minutes we were finally seated and then the waiter came outside to tell me that being angry didn’t do anything and that they would’ve seated them inside anyways. Really? That was not at all offered when we showed up. We were simply turned away and told to wait. When we finally sat down, considering the sun and the fact that other tables were now open we asked if we could move into the shade and the same waiter scoffed and made a face at the request. The owner is no better and is definitely behind the power trip that rude waiter is on because of lack of accountability and a culture that does not care about service, only making a profit. I’ve read the other reviews and they mention a staff member who had an attitude, and I’m sure I’m speaking about the same person in this review.'
Yuvraj Patel, 4 months ago, 4, 'Good food and good quantity! Nice place for breakfast, lunch and dinner in Hoboken! Not hard to find street parking on a bust day. Good options for non-veg, lesser options for veggies. Tried Kashmir panner(⭐⭐⭐)( PTM not available) and kofta kaju(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) for entrees and tandoori panner(⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐) for starter, panner was fresh and soft. Karma bread basket had veg and non veg options for naan and had a plenty amount of naam for party of 4. Unlimited papad and chutney, sabzi comes with rice and dal.

All the complex layers of flavors available in one bowl where each one can be picked up unmistakably by the palate.\n\nThe only two cons I found were 1) Tamarind still had the seeds in it 2) Quantity of Raita was too little to go with the biryani.\n\nI could eat this every week w/o a second thought.

I can understand you guys are busy but seriously you played with my religious practice for which I will take necessary steps.\nAlso there is one of the staff member who talks rudely and is arrogant ( trust me one can spot him easily) dude if you are frustrated with your job then please map the exit door.\nAbout owner thanks for offering me juice or the pudding as a bribe not to write any reviews or take any further action. You are elder figure to me but your Kafe’s Karma is not looking good. Good luck with your frustrated staff.'

Amish Bhavsar, 10 months ago, 1, "They served Vegetable Medley with the sticker on the Bell Pepper. That means they cooked the bell pepper with the sticker on it.

I reached out to the restaurant promptly to report this and they just asked me to contact Uber Eats customer service which I later did.\n\nDon’t ever serve food that doesn’t meet minimum safety / hygiene standards! Also, stop treating Indian desserts as second class (serving food with fungus just to empty out the stock is disgusting). Hope you fix such blunder going onwards.'

If they do provide fresh and hot food with better variety it will be worth visiting else it's worse than other Indian food place I have been to.There was just one dessert dish unlike other places which have some varieties to choose from.Overall I would give it 2 stars as the food was not fresh and didn't really stand out.If they organize the seating better and improve the quality and variety of dishes they offer I would reconsider visiting again or updating my review."

I told him mozzerela does not stretch specially when cold. He was not ready to accept it's a honest mistake and started arguing about it. So asked him to get a cold mozzerela piece and showed him that cold mozzerela does not stretch, it clearly did not (it fell apart in pieces and crumbs). He then came up with a new theory that it was a hot piece of mozzerela in that salsa. So asked him to heat it up and add it to salsa and bring it. Once again it did not stretch once the cheese was in cold salsa and cooled to below room temperature in cold salsa. Another waiter came and said they are sorry about it and offered free food. However we walked out without eating due to all the drama we had to put up to prove it was not mozzarella and was really a piece of gum. All they needed to do was accept their mistake in first place and move on.\n\nWe were a frequent customer but now completely lost trust in this place after finding gum in the food.\n\nNever going to go there again!"
Scott Wolfenden, 2 years ago, 5, 'Located on Washington St. in the heart of Hoboken, Karma Kafe offers great North Indian food with excellent service, good ambiance, with menu items and a lunch buffet with a generous selection of succulent Indian dishes and deserts.  The masala tea is authentic and tasty, just spicey enough, unlike some restaurants where the authenticity is hit and miss (freeze dried India tea with a pod of cardamom hardly qualifies as masala tea, which is what you get in some places). Weekday and weekend lunch usually draws something of a crowd, but  though the restaurant is usually close to full, there is rarely a wait for a table. Waiters are professionals who have been with the restaurant for years, a decade or more, friendly and helpful. The restaurant also features alcoholic beverages and a small bar. Dress is come as you are, whether casual or dressed for the office. It is not a place you will hang out all night, but where you are more likely to eat and leave when you are finished.'
