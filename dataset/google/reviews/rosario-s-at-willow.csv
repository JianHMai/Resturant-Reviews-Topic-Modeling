Peter Rothwell, a week ago, 3, 'Stopped by today for a slice of pizza at 2PM on a Tuesday.  The slice purchased was a dried slice, with a few fresh mushrooms added.  The mushrooms were the only fresh part of the pizza.  The pizza was not half as good as Natali‚Äôs up the street.'

Nothing is ever inedible or anything. Fresh bread,  margarita pizza is awesome but it‚Äôs not like a real margarita. It‚Äôs a cross between regular old school pizza and margarita but everyone always loves it and says it tastes really fresh. Cannolis are outstanding, fine dining quality.'
KAROL AGUILAR, 3 years ago, 2, "I ordered a pasta bolognese and was disappointed especially because I had a craving for this. The sauce was oily and the pasta was dry. Maybe they're known for other foods on their menu that taste better, but I probably won't order from here again."

Alyssa Russek, 5 years ago, 5, "I love pizza and will try pizza anywhere, being lactose intolerant like I am makes this an issue though. Living in this area gives you A LOT of options and helps you forget you shouldn't be having pizza. I've been around the slices in this town and I would call myself a pretty good judge. This pizza is absolutely amazing. Where many places fail is in the sauce. Rosario's sauce is perfection! The crust also perfectly complements the whole slice, not too much, not deep, and won't crack when you do the pizza fold. Also, and importantly, When you get it delivered it's still hot and tastes like it just came out of the over.\nLike many Americans I find french fries to be a staple in my diet. You can really fail when it comes to french fries.... but Rosario's isn't so. These fries have the perfect amount of salt and are exactly as crispy as you would hope they would be.\nAlso, the cannolis are life changing.\nHope this review helps!"
