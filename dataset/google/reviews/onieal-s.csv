Supratik Hajare, 21 hours ago, 3, 'I had the Ragin Cajun burger with six point double IPA beer. The portion size of burger size was small to the price I paid for the burger. The  funny part about this place is that the bar tender charged me $17 for a shot of Hennessy whiskey , which is super ridiculous on top the bar tender was super rude too. Overall, I would rate 3 on a scale of 5 for average food, service drink selections available.'

Everything I asked for was turned down. Just seemed like if I was a different person, I would have been treated better. I probably won't come back here. This calamari sums up my experience."

The two ladies that was there was awesome and I will definitely come back just to hang out."

Will be coming back!\nWalked in and was seated right away, no wait, which was great after the night I had had. The waitress so so sweet and kind and took our orders quickly. The place was pricier than I had expected, but due to the location I should have realized. The food was really good, so I did not mind paying. The environment was very calm in the back since we decided to get a table. By the bar the environment was more lively and there was even a disco ball which is hard to miss. 100% recommend!'

Eric Hammer, a year ago, 5, "One of the best burger spots in Hoboken with some of the best fries I've ever had.\n\nTake your pick with any of the burgers because I haven't had anything less than stellar. I can vouch for The Wall Streeter, The Alps, The All American, and The 3 B's.\n\nThe wings are excellent and the chicken quesadilla is surprisingly solid.\n\nI'm serious about the fries. Best in the city by far.\n\nDon't miss Onieals if you're in the area. It's everything you want and more in a casual but nice neighborhood bar. Cool place to hang and drink, but it's the fries and burgers that keep me coming back for more."

Life of Bo, 2 years ago, 4, 'Stopped in at 1:20 AM for some late night eats after a long night drinking. It is a small place and mostly the front of the bar was still open and the back was closed, but it was clear there was still enough people scattered in this restaurant.\n\nOrdered the Nachos with chicken and jalapeno cheese fries, um it was amazing!! I know that although we were drinking it may not be the best account but I was still sober and we were just snacking before we ended our night and literally it may be the best nachos that I have had in my life.\n\nChicken nachos, piled HIGH with guacamole, sour cream over a mound of nacho chips and cubed chicken pieces. The whole dish was clearly assembled then tossed into the oven so that all the cheese would melt nicely over the chips, it was literally amazing! Not sure why it was so good, but maybe it was the quantity of food, cheese, and guac or maybe I was just so surprised by the dish at this random bar.\n\nCheese fries were piping hot, cheesy and very nice. Would definitely order both items again the next time I am here. Drinks were standard quite nice, nothing to really complain about. Prices are standard for Hoboken, was just ecstatic to be pleasantly surprised before the end of the night.'
