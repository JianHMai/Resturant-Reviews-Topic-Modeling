Nitesh Maurya, a week ago, 5, "Staff is very polite and they know their coffee well. That's what every person needs before they start their hustle. What's more pleasing is that it's dog friendly and my joey just loves to hang out. Not to mention the doggy treats they dish out for my boy."

Amer A, 7 months ago, 3, 'Very quaint and cute place. The aroma that floats in the air is charming! The decor is unique. However, there is an inconsistency in the coffee execution. From the two cappuccino I ordered at the same time, one was balanced and tasted like a cappuccino, the other was scalding hot milk with barely a hint of coffee taste. I may give the place another chance, but with all the new coffee shops opening in the area, I will sample around, first.'

Makensey Lindaberry, 8 months ago, 5, 'Absolutely gorgeous! This is my favorite coffee shop in Hoboken. It has a beautiful atmosphere & the staff is incredibly sweet! The coffee is great and the pastries are delicious! The rose latte is one of the most beautiful cups of coffee I have ever had in my life. They also have a punch card program where after 10 cups of coffee you get the next one free. I recommend this place with the highest regards!'

Lyla Mannoia, a year ago, 1, 'I‚Äôve been here a few times now, each time hoping for the best. Nope. This place won‚Äôt be my first choice until things change. They have the most overpriced teas in all of Hoboken, maybe all of New Jersey. And not only are the teas overpriced, they‚Äôre usually anemic. I‚Äôve been disappointed each time.'

Des KF, a year ago, 4, "When I arrived I had to park illegally because parking in the area is terrible. The place had indoor and outdoor seating.  The place was super cute and I loved the decor. I was greeted by Balseyat, I believe she was the owner or manager and she was so kind. I got the baklava, which I was eager to try because it was my first time, and was supposed to get coffee. I told her I wasn't a huge coffee drinker so she offered me mint tea which was so nice of her. While waiting customers came in and one of which had a dog. So this place is dog friendly.  Balseyat gave me my items and I left.\n\nWhile driving home I was trying to drink the tea but the lid kept leaking a lot. It was dripping all over. Nothing was wrong with the lid, I just think they probably need better lids or cups. When I got home I I ate the baklava and it was just ok. It was very sweet but glad I finally got a chance to try."

Hilal Kahya, a year ago, 5, "That was a nice experience. I have never seen the place before. It was like a European style coffee shop. I believe they are new in town.  But coffee was top of the line and venue is good for studying for me. prices were also really cheap.   Unfortunately I couldn't stay very long due to current pandemic situation but this is the plan when this is all over."
Samantha, a year ago, 1, "I'd avoid getting their matcha lattes. I got one over the weekend and it basically tasted like just ice milk. There barely any matcha in it. The latte was a pale green color unlike the pictures of matcha they post on Instagram which is vibrant dark green. Not worth the money."
Katarzyna ≈Åugowska, a year ago, 5, 'Greta ice tea! I will definitely come back!'
Victoria Tobio, a year ago, 5, 'I have been coming here nearly everyday since they opened two weeks ago. The coffee and iced tea are super delicious! Don‚Äôt care for Starbucks anymore with this local place selling high quality drinks! Looking forward to trying the Turkish coffee once the weather gets a bit cooler. Staff is lovely and it‚Äôs women owned!! Highly recommend everyone visit Cafe Vista and super excited to try more options on their menu. Very happy this cute coffee shop opened up during the gloomy pandemic.'
