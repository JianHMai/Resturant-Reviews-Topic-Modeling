J. D. Baldwin, a month ago, 3, "COVID took them from 5-stars-plus to a mediocre three stars. Their menu, the food and other factors declined pretty severely. Had two disappointingly mediocre meals at this formerly excellent establishment.\n\nIt's still okay. You won't get a BAD meal or BAD service here. But there are literally a dozen terrific restaurants in Hoboken that kept their standards up, up, up, despite the setbacks of the pandemic and the government's response to it. Find and patronize them."
Ella Voloshina, a month ago, 5, 'I celebrated my daughters first birthday by throwing a brunch party at Sorellina. I was thrilled with the entire experience - from planning to the party itself. Nicole, the event coordinator, was incredibly patient and responsive, and assisted with and answered all of my questions (which were considerable). The day of the party, the Sorellina team was incredibly organized and the event ran very smoothly. They even made the outside area available for my guests! The food was excellent and the drinks were fantastic as well - my guests especially loved the aperol spritz’s. The crowning jewel of all of this was the desert table. I ordered a cake and a variety of goodies and the team at Sorellina helped organize it to be a beautiful dessert table. Even more than being beautiful, everything was absolutely delicious. The cake deserves its own shoutout because it was amazing. I’m so happy that I chose Sorellina for my baby’s party!'

Ronald White, 3 months ago, 2, 'This restaurant has AMAZING food. I was so excited to be seated with a physical menu and not one I needed to download. The options are truly chef inspired and a culinary delight. Our server took our appetizer and drink order and within a few minutes returned with our drinks.. However, he then proceeded to tell us that he could not put out appetizer order in without ordering our entrees at the same time. This was a kill moment. I didn\'t know what I would be having at that time. We were not given the option for ordering our entrees after our appetizers. So, we had to end our check. I never had this happen and was more than disappointed that we could NOT order more, as the food was most delicious. I hope that they are able to figure out this glitch, so that they are able to appropriately serve their future guests. I will never understand how hospitality is being controled by a "computer won\'t let me" attitude. After all, what good is having fantastic food, if you can\'t order it.'

Gary DeSarno, 3 months ago, 3, 'Very nice atmosphere here. Appetizers were amazing (bruschetta with burratta and strawberries and calamari with a blueberry sauce. Both were unlike anything I’ve had before, in a good way). Dessert also amazing, 7 layer cookie cake and chocolate donuts. Where we were disappointed was the pasta entrees. We got the Short Rib Farfalle and Rigatoni Bolognese, both were a let down, especially coming off of the fantastic appetizers. Would go again but probably just for a few drinks and appetizers.'
J F, 3 months ago, 1, "I've never felt so ripped off going out to dinner. The portions are so small and so expensive. I thought some of the pictures of the dishes were from people who already ate some of the dishes but they weren't! Ordered the calamari and it looked like someone are half the order. It was barely half a bowl. We also had the braised short rib farfalle. Thumbnail sized rib pieces and a handful of noodles for $25. Italian food is very cheap in general. Don't go here and get ripped off."

The outdoor seating had water dripping from some air conditioner above in the building."
Michael Natale, 5 months ago, 4, 'The quality of the food and drink is good.  The service lacks the attentiveness and organization required for the patron to experience a good flow in his/her dining.

So I ended up having my bridal shower here yesterday and it was so lovely!! Everything I hoped for and more!! Erica was super helpful at answering my million emails and questions (THANK YOU ERICA!!!) and made adjustments to the menu to accommodate guests that had special dietary restrictions. They were also so flexible about moving us from an outdoor to indoor  set up last minute because it ended up being really hot that day and I had concerns about whether people would be melting. All in all it was perfect, the food was delicious, the service was great and both Gabi and Erica were so wonderful to work with in making my bridal shower a success!

Place is very nice service was great, the atmosphere was also very good.\nNow the food was something else, there wasn’t one plate that we ordered that I could say was good.\nThe calamari was very salty, The bruschetta was the smallest I have ever been served, mostly decorative vegetables that were salty as well.\nWe order plain pasta with sauce for my 2 yr ok granddaughter and had to send it back , wasn’t cooked at all very hard. The dinner plates we ordered had no flavor and were cold, I can’t believe they make anything fresh here.\nI would  recognize this place if you just want to sit outside and have drinks, but the food was awful and over priced for the quality..Service was good just wish the was to .'

Kristina Grosso, a year ago, 3, 'Met a good friend for dinner here that i have not seen in awhile. We were informed of the 90 minute table time limit at the beginning which is fair because we agreed. Hostess was very nice. My issue is about 10 minutes before the 90 minutes was up, we asked to order dessert and dessert cocktails.  The waiter said sure and then dissapeared.  A few minutes later, a manager appeared and just put the check on our table with no explanation. We said, oh we would like to order dessert and he said sorry but the 90 minutes is up.\nI understand that these restaurants are trying to make money and turn tables quickly and its a difficult time for them but this really turned me off to be honest. We had just ordered drinks, appetizers, and meal enteees and spent a good amount of money. We were enjoying our dinner at a reasonable pace and asked to order more, not to just sit with the check and hold up a table.  What turned me off even more was they then took their sweet time to take our credit cards to pay and we probabaly could have enjoyed dessert during that period of time. We then went to buy our own liquor to make our own dessert cocktails at home and walked by 10 minutes later and the table was still empty.\nI like to enjoy the experience of dining out when spending that amount of money on a meal and the feeling of being rushed out was not worth it to me and i probabaly will not go back because of it.'

Amazing food and good drinks, but where it really fell short was the customer service and the cold food.\n\nThe customer service could have been way better... I really believe it may have been our server, as it seemed everyone else was well attended to. We requested water and it was never brought. However, the couple behind me was offered water for their dog multiple times. He stayed at their table and attended to them and their dog continously. We had to ask for bread during our dinner course, yet it was served to everyone else upon being seated.\n\nThe food was amazing, just very unfortunate that it was served cold to us 45 minutes after sitting down. Our meatball appetizer and pasta with bolognese both seemed to have sat in the kitchen for an extended period of time prior to being served to us.\n\nI will go back again in hopes of better service.'

Fiona Connel, 2 years ago, 3, 'Usually love this place. Very disappointed tonight. Felt invisible to bartenders upon arrival...food took way too long to arrive and between the 2 courses. Offered a glass of wine for the wait and got given a short pour. Main dish deffo sub par to normal. Took edge off whole evening.'
Alaa A, 2 years ago, 4, "Wait staff was on point, very friendly and great recommendations. Saffron Bucatino minus the pancetta was great, Sirloin Flank steak was highly recommended but it's was quite dry (ordered medium) came out medium well. Bread options were great, all freshly hand made."

We had hoped to eat a bit down memory lane at one of the older Hoboken sauce joints, but one was closed for 3 month reno, the other fully booked. Took a chance here at 9:45pm. Place was half-full, as it was late on a cold March Friday night. Lent ... not any fish options except salad and soup, which was weird in an Italian place. We had to pick meat dishes and pretended it was after midnight and no longer Friday in Lent. Meatballs were good, steak was tasty, wine was delish. The only thing we really were bummed about was the cold, no candles, no flourishes mini ice cream sandwich plunked down on the table ... after we told the waitress it was a birthday celebration and made a special request for a little something extra. No one conveyed this to the kitchen. Underwhelming.'

However, the other reviews about it being more expensive than it was worth felt really true.\n\nWe didn\'t enjoy the crudite, pasta was pretty good.\nAtmosphere feels like it\'s catering to a large crowd - sports bar style TVs while boasting fine italian food.\n\nWe asked to cork the wine to take home; the server was accomodating. Then the busboy whisked in and took the wine away while we went to the restroom. Honest mistake but super frustrating. His reply when when we asked about it - "Oh, I threw it out. I can get you a cork though." My dear consolation prize...\n\nThe owner was sitting at the bar watching the exvhange and didn\'t say a word, which was weird.\n\nOverall not a place for a romantic evening, maybe go with a buddy to get some quick food.'

We’ve visited the restaurant a few times and have had consistent service and excellent meals. The pasta dishes are the shining stars of the menus. With so many dining options possible in Hoboken I’m okay with saying I’d go to Sorrellina’s multiple times before exploring other options because it’s just that good. We will be back!'

Melanie Tam, 4 years ago, 2, "Since my boyfriend is new to Hoboken, we decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. We passed by Sorellina, which looked like a cute date spot. Since we had some time to kill, we decided to grab a drink.\n\nI had the Forza Negroni (Bulleit Bourbon, Sweet Vermouth, Campari) and he had the Classico Negroni (Dorothy Parker Gin, Carpano Antica Vermouth, Campari). Both tasted pretty similar and had a little too much Campari for my taste. You're probably better off sticking to a glass of vino from their wine list, which is pretty extensive and reasonably priced.\n\nSome of the appetizers stood out to us so we also ordered a bite to eat. We had the Grilled Cherrystone Clam Spiedini {with housemade chorizo, caracara orange marmalade & sourdough croutons} and Nonna's Meatballs (pomodoro braised veal & ricotta). Neither of these appetizers were good. They certainly looked appetizing but that was about it. The clams were ridiculously chewy. I even tried cutting them up into super tiny pieces but even then, it was extremely difficult to eat. The meatballs had an okay flavor but the texture was just not the way meatballs should be. I don't know what it was - maybe they ground up their meat too much but the consistency was that of a hot dog. My boyfriend compared it to a Vienna sausage.\n\nI was really hoping to like this place but if the appetizers we ordered weren't very good, I'm not sure if I would want to be back to try the mains. Guess we'll just have to find another go-to Italian spot in the neighborhood."
