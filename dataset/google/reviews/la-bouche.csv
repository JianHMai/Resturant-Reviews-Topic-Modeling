Roger Villeda, 2 months ago, 5, "Randomly selected this restaurant on our way home after visiting Manhattan. Great surprise! Food was delicious, lady was very nice and food came out pretty quick too. It's small inside but outside seating was available. Ordered the Croque Foresti√®re, pomme frites and an Arnold Palmer. Definitely would visit again"
Shawn Varughese, 2 months ago, 3, "I came here with a group of four on a Saturday morning for brunch. The ambience and the conversation was excellent but the food wasn't as tasty as we expected. We ordered three items, brioche french toast, fruity crepe, and the ham omelette. The brioche french toast was not soft and seemed dried out. The crepe was larger than we expected but the texture was very thin and fell apart which made it difficult to eat. Finally, the omelette was my favorite item on the menu and came with a large portion size. However nothing stood out in terms of flavor. While the location and ambience were great, we were disappointed overall with the food quality given the cost."
Tsz Kuk Daisy Leung, 2 months ago, 1, "Highly recommend coming here if you are looking for one of a kind dining experience. It will help you appreciate life and people around more.\n\nWe came here on Saturday around 1pm for brunch. There were plenty of outdoor seating. We asked to be seated and was seated not according to the order at which customers arrive. The owner sat another party who arrived after us before attending to us. While he had offered us to choose between indoor and outdoor seating, we opted for outdoor, given that we have a dog with us. I had asked if we could sit by the desk closest to the store to avoid the dog from getting distracted by pedestrians and to be able to settle. He declined in a rather rude manner.\n\nAs we were seated, he came to take ours orders and demonstrated that he was rather impatient with his customers.\n\nWhile we had asked for water, we weren't given any. Instead the owner just stood by the store front.\n\nThere was a flowerless plant next to our table, which had a disgusting chicken wing bone inside. Our dog sniffed the plant and found the gross bone inside the plant, causing her to keep sniffing there. According to the owner, this is a plant he had water daily for a year. I was surprised that he had no idea what kind of rotten bone was hidden there. To prevent my dog from swallowing it, I grabbed the bone and tossed it. I went to restroom to wash and sanitizer my fingers. The moment I came back out, he came to us and complained to us about our dog eating the flowers from his precious flowerless plant that he had babied for a year. At this point, we decided we have enough opportunity to appreciate how lucky we have been in life to be surrounded by kind folks, we left. I am sorry for the bitter owner, whatever may have happened in his life.\n\nWhile the owner has an attitude towards dogs and their owners, all his customers are friendly. They love our dog, and so does the owner next door, who offered water for our dog and to pet her.\n\nIf you are too sick of nice people, or need to be reminded how lucky you have been in life, this is the place for you. I am rooting for this place!\n\nIf google map offers negative stars, this place will receive a -5 stars. It's the best of the worst!"

nalin ahuja, 3 months ago, 1, 'Bad tasting food. No flavors, very bland. We ordered an avacado toast and a Greek omelette. Avacado toast had absolutely no flavors, not even salt. We had to ask for it separately. Same thing for the omelette. It was just fluffy and even with hot sauce, I was finding it hard to eat. We did not finish the food as the restaurant is claiming that we did.'
C O, 3 months ago, 1, 'If you are willing to have a good experience, this is not the best place. I went there for a breakfast on my own. And was clear that the manager (the guy who managers table) don‚Äôt see the customers as customers and just like money, was clearly the difference how he treated me different just because I was alone and automatically I was going to spent less then the other people. He asked nice to take one of the chairs from the table I was and but then he told me he needed more chairs and more tables (that was a indirect way to tell to leave). The food super was cold, nobody brought me water. And at the end I asked for a box for my leftover sandwich and a to go cup for my coffee that he didn‚Äôt listen to, so when he came back just with the box for the sandwich I was for the cup again and he impolitely rolled his eyes to me like I was annoying him.\nSo obviously I am not going back.'

Khushboo Gambhir, 3 months ago, 2, "We went for lunch and ordered veggie sandwich and smoked salmon sandwich. The veggie sandwich was too bland (almost no salt) and salmon sandwich was way too salty. Also, the way they bill is very weird as they do not give you a breakdown. I felt I was charged more and reading the comments I think they did charge 4$ for 2 of us as cover fee or reservation fee or whatever fancy name you wanna give. It seemed sort of a cheating in a way. They should be upfront about these charges not try to hide it by not giving a breakdown of the bill.\n\nTo Owner: Thank you so much for such a humble reply, probably next time you can also comment on food. I wouldn't have bother about $4 extra had I not paid for 2nd lunch from somewhere else."

Not just was he hesitant in showing the check, which is a consumer‚Äôs right, he also got angry at us for asking for the receipt.

Indeed, a group that was dining outdoors when we arrived was still comfortably seated when we exited after being asked to wrap up and leave.\n\nETA : Contrary to the response below, I am afraid to say we were never informed about the 45 minute rule when being seated. The first we heard about it was when we were asked to wrap up and leave. We were quite taken aback by the service and needless to say, are unlikely to be back."

I explained that I am fine with the cappucino for now but that I will order more after a while. She kept coming and giving me looks. I thought that she might not like it that I sit there with my laptop. I told her politely that she may feel free to move me to a single table if she needs the table for larger groups. In the meantime there were still empty large tables. She answered: yeah ok and again gave me some look. I felt so uncomfortable that I ordered  lunch quite early. I asked the cheque and her communication around that was also zero. As a costomer I had way more polite and friendly behaviour towards her than she towards me.

The Belgian waffle was bland and tasted like it came out of a card board box so far from what a Belgian waffle actually is I don't think they can be called the same thing.\n\nThis place is about as French as Chef Boyardee is Italian."

Gunn Mickieo, 3 years ago, 4, 'We ordered salmon tartine and the lemon ricotta souffl√© pancakes. We got there around 11 am , the wait line was 15 minutes. The salmon tartine was really good , the salmon was well balanced with onions, pickles and the sauce, the toast was crunchy and the omelette fluffy and tender, we ordered hash browns with the salmon tartine, and it was perfectly crispy. The pancakes were fluffy, crispy on the edges and tender in the center , and the flavor was great.'

Myrna Hilton Woods, 3 years ago, 2, "I was extremely happy with this place in the beginning but my latest order had me very disappointed. The tomato soup and half smoked salmon sandwich special was my go to for lunch. It started off great , but the quality declined after.  I had decided not to go back because the bread was cold from my last order (like it was just taken out of the refrigerator) and not toasted or heated which took away from the sandwich, but I decided to give it one more try. This time my meal was incomplete without the usual side of greens which is a huge no no for me. I felt like I was getting less than what I paid for. It may seem like something simple to some but you never know what aspect of a meal gratifies a customer. I did return the incomplete meal to which she threw a couple of leaves in there. I had referred this place to a couple of friends for a light and healthy lunch but sadly I will not be returning or referring. If the owner is the person who prepared my sandwich I'm pretty sure she will know who I am after reading this."

Malavika Muralidharan, 3 years ago, 4, "Very cute little cafe. Cosy seats and nice decor! I bought the lunch special (small soup and sandwich) which was delicious. Croutons and cheese on the soup were good. Will definitely return to try other things on the menu. Took one star off because the soup was luke warm and there was no spoon in the utensils pack (which I would think is important when someone's buying soup!)."
Rebecca Mozdy, 3 years ago, 1, 'Seemed like a nice place. But then the waitress told us she wouldn‚Äôt bring us water because we had laptops on the table. And then she asked us to move for new customers even though we had ordered drinks five minutes earlier. I‚Äôve never had that happen before. We finished our drinks as quickly as we could and I doubt we‚Äôll ever come back.'
Bronwyn Held, 3 years ago, 5, "Tiny cafe so you'll have to wait but it's worth it. The food is amazing. They have classics like omelettes and crepes but also odd stuff like salted caramel with bacon and cheese which was really good. Excellent drinks too. Really cozy place that deserves a visit"

All of the items on the menu look so great but when I get the food it is always pretty bland. Most recently I had the avocado toast with a poached egg and ‚Äújalape√±o salsa‚Äù and was very disappointed.. the jalape√±o salsa had no spice and MUST have come from a jar.. tasted exactly like Tostitos! It drenched my food and made the bread very soggy.\nOn a positive note the inside decor is adorable and the cappuccinos are yummy...'

Brittany Deeney, 4 years ago, 1, 'Came in,  everything was good/ good vibes. The waitress pointed us toward a table & we sat. The waitress Came out with our food & my order was not correct.  She asked me if I was fine with just keeping the meal how I had it. I decided to tell them to remake it (something I never do). The seem to be owner manager/ than came up to us and asked us to sit at another table/ while my other friends had their entrees in front of them. Completely shocked by this request/ we decided to just sit where we were. We also had ice coffee from a different restaurant and left mine on the table. The manager ran outside and asked me to take it. & than prodceeed to walk outside and throw the ice coffee at a public trash can. Honestly just bazarre and confused why the manager was acting this way to paying customers. I would not go back.'

Erin Fitzpatrick, 4 years ago, 3, "I was really excited to try this place, especially after a recent trip to France. The food was excellent but I was really disappointed with the level of service we received. It was almost like they kept forgetting we were there. I noticed everyone else got a pitcher of water immediately when they were seated, and it wasn't until I asked someone after about 20 minutes if we could get water that we got ours. Also, it took about 25 minutes for our coffee orders to come - we were still waiting for them as people who sat down after us were getting their meals. Then, my husband got his meal and I told him to go ahead and start eating, thinking mine would come soon, and he was finished eating before mine came about 10 minutes later.\n\nI would like to give them another chance because it seemed like everyone else was getting perfectly fine service, I was just very disappointed this time."
