I am\nready for bed LOL.'
Marlee Ann-Marie, 3 weeks ago, 3, 'Avoid delivery if you can. First time I ordered they messed up the order but they refunded us which was nice.\n\nSecond time - I ordered the Hoboken Lobster Roll & it was disappointing. It was just on a romaine leaf - except the leaf was wilted due to the heat from the fries thrown on top. Not crisp and fresh like someone would expect a lettuce wrap to be. Would be better to keep the greens separate for delivering something like this. The amount of lobster was also disappointing.'
Andrew Price, a month ago, 4, 'Food was delicious, but the Bed-stuy Biggie Roll (the one on the right in my side by side photo) had less lobster than the $6 cheaper BK Sauce Roll.'
Kaylla Silva, a month ago, 5, 'Very delicious food and very attentive staff!'
Leslie Howard, a month ago, 2, "Food was not as described - not made of claw meat. More like a spread into roll. Delivery went to wrong bldg then didn't follow provided instructions to get into bldg. Unlikely to order again. This is what a lobster roll is supposed to look like. That is NOT what you get from BK Hoboken."

Valentina Herrera, a month ago, 4, 'I was talking on the phone with a friend when they said they knew a great hot dog spot in Hoboken. I said lets go and have dinner there, turns out its not hot dogs but lobster rolls... We ended up staying because of the menu options. I ordered the flatbush roll, it has a jamaican jerk seasoning. I wanted something spicy and to burn my mouth but it was more of a bbq sauce. Too sweet and it fought against the already sweet lobster meat. The bun was delicious, toasty and buttery and those fries! Wow those fries were seasoned perfectly and crisp outside with a fluffy inside. When I come back I might opt for a more simple seasoning, that way I can enjoy the sweet lobster meat. The service was excellent, the chef and cashier were sweet, helpful and offered great service. There are tables you can sit outside and inside the location. The prices are quite fair for what you are receiving, a loaded bun with lobster and a huge amount of fries.'
Dashawnia Magazine, a month ago, 5, 'Me and my friends went to BK lobster today and literally everything was delicious!!! We ordered BK lobster Roll, Bed stey Roll, lobster fries, corn, lobster Mac and we must say MADE TO PERFECTION!!!!!  We will definitely be coming back!!!'

I will order again and I hope next time I will receive all items that I order.'
Jacqueline Aguilar, 2 months ago, 5, 'Omg!!!! Lobster rolls! ü¶û super delicious. I had the classic my partner had the butter and lemon. I really loved the buttery lemon lobster roll with a side spring salad.  Amazing!!  Fresh!  10 stars. They also serve decent portions so you‚Äôre definitely getting your money‚Äôs worth. Also, the fries are heavily seasoned - wasn‚Äôt my  fave. But still good. :) can‚Äôt wait to come back.. I‚Äôm already planning on it.'
Gloria Grant, 2 months ago, 4, 'I had fried lobster and fries. The food was tasty. The fries were seasoned. I also got steamed lobster to go with fries. Which I ate the next day and it was good'
Alexis Stanley, 3 months ago, 5, 'This place did not disappoint at all. I met a friend for lunch at BK Lobster in Hoboken and honestly this is one of the best lobster rolls I\'ve ever had. When we arrived the owner was there and gave us first class service from start to finish. They don\'t really have a lot of seating inside so we sat outside at one of their sidewalk tables. My friend got the classic lobster roll and I got the "crown heights" roll which was fried lobster and some sort of aioli. It was so good. It comes with fries or a salad and I chose the fries but they gave us so much I barely finished. Also as it\'s moniker states this place exclusively sells only lobster rolls (i think they might have salads but why go to a lobster roll place if u wanna get a salad you know?). I definitely would come back.'
kelsy saldana, 3 months ago, 1, 'An absolute joke of a store. They treated my girlfriend terribly. A grown woman by the name of Tiff curses at her staff, yelled and cursed at my girlfriend who is SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD for simply doing her job, and was unpleasantly rude when I tried to enter the store.

David Torres, 4 months ago, 3, "Didn't have a great experience here, the rolls are OK but it's expensive for what you get.

There were in fact other customers also impatient about how they were handling the orders."

Gold Poodle, 5 months ago, 5, 'I have been to many BK Lobster locations between  NY and NJ.  All locations between NY and NJ have  been consistent and the food is very tasty.   The staff and management work very hard to satisfy their customers and communities.  Very impressive that the Hoboken location came up with the Hoboken roll for the Hoboken community.  Anyone can get the lobster roll classics as well as the scrumptious new options such as the Italian Bay Ridge Roll and the Jamaican Jerk sauce roll, the Flatbush roll.    The Fries, the fries, the fries‚Ä¶. Whether lightly seasoned or well-season, can never pass up on fries!'
Kelly Oliva, 5 months ago, 1, 'Terrible service. The lobster was dry and chewy. The seasoning doesn‚Äôt taste good.'
Joseph Fung, 5 months ago, 4, 'For the lobster lover, there\'s a nice assortment of appetizers and entrees. The lobster roll variety goes beyond the standard Maine and Connecticut styles, and adds some unique signature offerings, including the "Bed Stuy" Biggie Roll, Crown Heights Fried Lobster Roll, and Flatbush Roll. The latter two are drizzled with chipotle and jerk sauce, respectively, to add a nice kick. If you\'re not in the mood for a roll, go for the Fried Lobster. You get chunks of perfectly fried and lightly battered lobster that is not greasy or overcooked. All are served with tasty, seasoned fries. This will be a fine addition to Hoboken, and offers some innovative items, and is a step above the old Luke\'s Lobster that used to be in town. During Grand Opening, they were a bit disorganized and waits were around half an hour, but the staff was earnest. Chalk it up to opening day issues.'

T. Pisani, 5 months ago, 4, "I was excited to see this place was coming to town and wanted to give it a fair shot. Overall the food was decent but just overpriced. $22 for a 6 inch lobster roll?? Nuts. It's one thing for a sit down restaurant with waiters but for a fast takeout place the price needs to be closer to $15 to make me ever go back."
Alan K, 5 months ago, 1, 'Sunday afternoon, slow and i walk right in to order. The staff has no clue what they are doing and the lady that works at the front was not pleasant. Lobster and fries took over 30 min!? You‚Äôre the lobster place. Put it on the roll salt the fries and let‚Äôs go. Holy moly.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to come back here. I read the reviews and saw similar comments from weeks ago and no improvement. Hey owner! , I eat out all the time (nice), I live two blocks away, let‚Äôs assume my lady and I eat 3 meals a month between us on average. You just lost $900 a year! Not good!\n\nGet your staff to know the basic stuff, have them be friendly, and don‚Äôt take 30 min! Ez peezy!'

I received my roll within 5 minutes.\n\nI've tried the biggie, classic, and crown heights rolls, all very flavorful and surprisingly had a lot of lobster meat, the most being the biggie roll. More than I expected. The fries that came with it were well seasoned, crispy on the outside and still maintained the potato flavor- just like I like it!\n\nI can't wait to try more items on the menu.

I ordered a Connecticut roll $21 and a Bed Stuy Roll for like $28 both were exactly the same taste & looked the same.  Then I ordered the fried lobster all I tasted was the batter didn‚Äôt taste like lobster at all!!  They seem to use the claws of the lobster mostly I really didn‚Äôt see lobster tail!! That seasoning they put on everything is not good at all I hated it so much!!! When I get lobster rolls from the Point in Point Pleasant you see the lobster meat tail and all that‚Äôs a lobster roll, not this chopped up whatever BK lobster serves!  The service I gave a decent tip and waited for like 45 min  people that came after me got their food they gave me one of my rolls had to wait another half an hour for the rest.  I will never go back not worth it al all!!!'

James Noonan, 5 months ago, 3, 'Overpriced for what you get which is mainly a lot of undercooked French Fries but seasoned nicely. I ordered 2 Bed Stuy Biggie Rolls. First they tried to overcharge me by including the tax in the item price and then adding tax again to the sub total. The cashier couldn‚Äôt figure it out!? Finally had to enter a custom priced item?? Watch your charges. The Brioche roll is good, the lobster meat and portion size was okay but a little dry. They melt a little butter and lemon juice with it in an oven to heat up each portion then sprinkle a little Old Bay type seasoning on. I‚Äôve had much better at the Jersey shore for less money.'

Yolanda Flores, 6 months ago, 1, 'Was very excited today for BK Lobster to come to Hoboken, told family and friends about the grand opening, but what a let down. First and foremost there was no organization nor no practicing 6 feet distance. Everyone was bunched in, no structure. I couldn‚Äôt tell who were the employees just people walking in or out. No one greeting anyone or at least giving directions where to stand on line to order. It was just chaos‚Äôs. That‚Äôs not even the bad part, I placed my order at 9:41, 1 shrimp, 2 fried lobster I got my order at 10:15, 35 minutes of waiting. At one point I had to flag down whom appeared to be an employee and ask if they can check on my order. Apparently I think they skipped my order because I observed them as the employee was inquiring about my order then you can see them searching for my name and then that was another 15 minute wait. I felt embarrassed at one point because everyone kept staring at me like saying why is she still here. It was awkward! The bad part I left a nice tip and the food was cold. The food looked like they rush to put the order together because they knew they messed up my order. No Bueno!! Very disappointed with BK Lobster in my home town. Moving forward wish you all the best.'
