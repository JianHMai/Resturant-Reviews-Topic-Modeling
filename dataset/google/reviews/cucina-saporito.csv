Would highly recommend it.'

Rony Francisco, 3 months ago, 5, 'Dear owner of this restaurant,\n\nI really hope you take a hard look at this comment and please answer me one question or maybe a few.\n\nFirst of how do you become, undoubtedly one the best Italian cuisine restaurant in New Jersey. The taste of the food, the immaculate amazing over exceeding my expectations customer services. One word, wow. My family and I had the honor/privilege to eat at this establishment last night on Tuesday. It was a table of 9, instantly we were seated and immediately attended too. My other question is simple, how do you become such an iconic Hoboken hidden gem according to Girls Blog and I was not told. Once again amazing'
Nauman Butt, 3 months ago, 5, 'Exceeded my expectations. It looks nice from outside but their service is definitely far better than one can expect. The seating host who also was our server due to being short staffed was very friendly and courteous. And he made excellent recommendations on our meal.\n\nWe decided on ordering a pasta special as an appetizer. It was lobster ravioli with salmon along with tomato based cream sauce. Just writing about it is making me hungry. It was simply delicious.\n\nThen we got a plate of bruschetta on the house. That was indeed very sweet of them.\n\nFinally we ended our meal with an entree of their chicken special of the day which came with lemon based sauce and sautéed spinach. Also a great dish.\n\nThe fact that it’s BYOB just made the evening perfect.'

Tank has an amazing personality and made our visit more of an experience, rather than just a meal. I ate a salad, the manicotti, & tiramisu (ORDER that tiramisu, I guarantee it’s the best one you’ll ever have). There was not a single bite left on any of the plates we ordered. Food was absolutely amazing. Everything is incredibly fresh and perfectly done. If you want Italian, this is the spot.'

They even remembered mine and my wife’s names when we arrived on our second visit here! I don’t think I’ve EVER had an empty glass of water and their specials are second to none. The pasta itself is so good; just like nonna used to make. I personally always order the chicken parm and they make it to order with a little extra kick upon request. Truly an unsung hero of Hoboken.'

Lauren, 2 years ago, 1, 'We had a very terrible dining experience the other night. We waited almost two hours for our entrees and watched two tables come and go before we ever got ours. We had to ask for water, menus and utensils because no one even came over to our table to get us situated after we were seated. The few times we would ask for these things the staff would give us attitude as if we were inconveniencing them. It was 30 minutes before someone even came over to our table to tell us the specials. Our cold app was gross - burrata on a hard, inedible  tomato and asparagus wrapped in prosciutto.\n\nThey clearly forgot about our table - when our entrees finally came out my fiancé’s dish was ice cold and was served on wilted lettuce. It was a completely underwhelming meal. I will say my gluten free carbonara was delicious though.\n\nWe’re completely reasonable and understand bad nights happen, so I quietly let the manager know about our experience. I really appreciated how apologetic he was, and they did take a meal off of our bill. However, at the end of the night we were still paying $50+ for mostly bad food, non existence service, and a free limoncello shot? It was our first and last time coming here.\n\nI’m super disappointed because this place came highly recommended and this was probably the worst dining experience I’ve ever had out. We were celebrating our 4 year anniversary, and the entire experience just added so much tension and exhaustion to the night. Again, I very much appreciate how the manager handled the situation, but if the roles were flipped I would have never charged someone for that experience.'

I said I would check into it and hung up.\n\nI looked on Groupon and found a Fri/sat/Sun night offer for $30 that included an appetizer, two entrees and two beverages. It seemed like a good deal, so I bought it for $30.\n\nI then called the restaurant right back and said I'd like to make a reservation, and that I had the Groupon offer.  The manager/owner then told me they were not taking any more reservations for Groupon holders  that night!\n\nI pointed out that 5 minutes before, he recommended I get the Groupon in order to make the reservation.  He began arguing with me and told me I took too long (5 minutes) and that all the reservations were taken.  I started to protest, at which point he hung up on me.\n\nSo, I basically spent $30 on his restaurant, and then he wouldn't let me get the service I had already paid for!\n\nWHAT THE F---?!?!?\n\nWhat kind of manager/owner treats his customers this way?\n\nWe live nearby so we went to the restaurant and it was only half full.  I requested a seat by the window, and the host said 'no problem.'  Then I asked to speak to the manager.\n\nWhen he arrived I pointed out that his restaurant was about to seat us, but he had said only 20 minutes before that they couldn't seat us because of the Groupon offer.\n\nSo, he started ARGUING with us again!\n\nWe were trying to spend money at his establishment and he is treating us like garbage!\n\nI told him I would write a bad review, and he said he is the Manager and the Owner and that  I should 'go ahead and do it'.\n\nSo here it is, Sir, a negative review for treating your customers badly, giving a bad recommendation, lying about the available tables, and then even making a scene in your own restaurant, loudly arguing, embarrassing your diners, embarrassing  us, and embarrassing yourself.\n\nShame on you!  This is no way to treat your customers and is inexcusable.\n\nYou said to go ahead and post a bad review.  So, I plan to post this review elsewhere to warn all customers not to do business with your establishment.\n\nDo not dine here as the manager/owner doesn't know how to treat paying customers, and doesn't care when they protest his rotten treatment.\n\nHorrible!"
