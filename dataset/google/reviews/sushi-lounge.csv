Probably one of the worst encounters I‚Äôve had with a server at a restaurant. My sushi came out 30 mins after my food and it was the smallest portion I‚Äôve ever had in my life.

Tanya Christian, 4 months ago, 3, "My first and last visit to Sushi Lounge was disappointing to put it nicely. While I want to believe the restaurant was simply having an off day, my experience was enough to lead me not return. From the time my guest and I checked in, things gradually went down hill. To start off, we were seated for more than 20 minutes before our waitress came to take our order, and that was after I walked inside and brought it to the attention of the host. I excused this because the wait staff was apologetic, and were kind enough to comp our 2 cocktails, but my issues didn't end there. My fianc√© ordered the shrimp risotta and seemed to enjoy it, but I was disappointed that the shrimp was overcooked (read: tough). The second starter was calamari, and by far the worse dish we had that night. It was obvious from the rubbery/ extra chewy texture that the calamari was overcooked as well (it's even obvious from the photos). I brought it to the attention of my waiter who apologized and then removed the plate from the table. We proceeded to delve into our sushi rolls. Both of us ordered spicy rolls (one shrimp, one crab) but the spice wasn't at all evident. I was extremely underwhelmed. When the check came our waitress let us know that they took 30% off of the calamari starter. Though I didn't make a fuss, I do think it was in poor taste that they would remove the dish from our table (after only having a few bites) and not completely remove it from the tab, altogether. Every restaurant does customer service differently but I found that a bit crass on the restaurant's part. The truth is we were hoping to have a full meal (starters, rolls, and entrees) at the Sushi Lounge, but by the time we made it to the rolls, it was obvious we needed to cut our losses. This restaurant gets 3 stars overall because I want to believe the waitstaff did what was in their power to make it a pleasent dining experience. If I was judging food and drinks alone, it would have received a 2."

Tonight I called to order pick up and was told I had to do this through the website and could not place it over the phone. And then it was not until I had picked up my food and gotten home that I realized 3 of my ordered items were missing. Which having known or been informed I would have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere. But of course no one had made me aware of that when picking up my food. When I called to resolve the issue of course there was no manager to speak with only a nasty employee. And this is not the first time I‚Äôve been told that when calling to resolve an issue. I will never order from here again. Overpriced and overrated.'

Radha Kapoor, a year ago, 1, 'Unfortunately, I have a shellfish allergy, and love Sushi. I have never had an issue eating sushi despite this allergy. Unfortunately, this past weekend I did. I informed the waitress that I had an allergy to shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster) and ordered two rolls ( shellfish free rolls) and specified that they be on a plate separate from all the other sushi being ordered. I was served ( and ate) a roll that had shrimp inside of the roll. According to the staff, the chef put the wrong sauce on top of the roll, which somehow explained why I was served shellfish. I had a severe allergic reaction, left dinner to go get an Epi pen, and came back to a bill from the manager( who was well aware that I was having a severe allergic reaction from the meal they served me). We declined the bill, asked to speak with the owner, who was on "vacation" to return on Monday. Well its Wednesday, we still havent gotten a phone call or apology. I am still suffering the consequences of the allergic reaction I had 5 nights ago. Please beware of this place if you have allergies, not safe.'

Peppers weren't as tasty and we'll salted to my liking, but still delicious. Coconut shrimp came w/three long pieces, each piece deep fried in coconut flakes.\nWe ordered three different specialty rolls: Hoboken, Crazy8, and Motown. All very delicious. If you love spicy as I do, crazy8 is made w/jalapenos - perfect spicy for a roll.\nMy 4 star is due to the drink. I ordered the sake punch and did not like it at all. I made my husband try it w/o knowing my personal opinion and we both agreed it tasted like cough syrup. Would definitely not order again."

Josue Martinez, 2 years ago, 1, 'Worst Experience Ever! I\'m expecting a safe, fun, chill environment but instead I am getting a manager screaming a couple of workers and blaming these poor young women. The manager\'s name I believe is Stacey and she threatens these girls by saying things such as ,"I run this business and without me it would be nothing", or such as "You guys don\'t know how to do anything without me". It was a poor experience because through all that I just had to hear her nagging and was not able to enjoy my food even though my waiter was good.'
Jackson Luis, 2 years ago, 5, "Great service and value, especially the lunch specials. Only thing I'd say needs improvement is the choice of spoons they give when you soup to go. The disposable spoon is really sharp on the edges and cut the corners of my mouth (felt like a paper cut). I'd love it if they changed the brand of spoons they use. It's a nit pick but an issue worth noting."

The sushi is average (thats the only thing I've ever ordered), but the service is just terrible. Whenever I've been in there there's only been a few other patrons, so never very busy, and the service is SLOW. Slow to take your order, slow to get your food, and slow to get your check. One of the last times I was in there, we finally had to go ask for our check. We had been there for over an hour for lunch and had to get back to the office. If it was busy due to a lunch rush, I could understand, but our group of 3 were the only ones in the restaurant. The waitresses are always just standing around. I also find the seating highly uncomfortable. Feels like your sitting on top of the person next to you, I couldn't imagine going to dinner here."

If I had to nitpick one thing, it would only be, that they could have cut the roll into smaller pieces and that's not even a big deal.

The first time I brought my wall street friend to this place. Needless to say,  these kind of new yorkers don't like time wasted or poor service. INTOLERANT is an understatement! Long story short, after 16 minutes of no one coming up to even take our order, not even a glass of water,  we left WITHOUT eating! The guy has places to be, & nj already sucks because sushi place has servers giggling by the bar & playing on their phones, yet we were waiting for our orders to be taken.\n\nThe second time, I came with another friend, same story.  The girl servers are immature & probaby don't really care for this job or the customers.  The girls were busy on their phones in customers' plain view & were chatting & laughing by the bar, WHILE SERVICE HAD NOT BEEN RENDERED. Again, we were waiting for someone to even get our order & when someone did,  it was another bout of waiting for the food to be served. Additionally, no one checked whether we needed anything once they brought our OVERDELAYED orders to the table. My friends & I will not be coming back. There are sushi places well deserving of our business.\n\nAdvice for management: FIRE YOUR INEPT GIRLS/SERVERS and hire people who are serious about their work! Otherwise, those girls, will eventually tank your business."

laura sanchez, 4 years ago, 1, "I've been here a few times. I love the food and blood orange martini is my favorite. But the food is literally the only reason I go back. Happy hour is a great price. But unfortunately the girls freaking suck. Every time I go I'm always waiting to take my order , one time my food came b4 my actual drink and it was the wrong drink. My entree finally came and so did my correct drink. I also went another time and sat outside. They must of forgot I was there. I went inside and asked to take my order since I was outside. My app and entree took forever not even to mention I still had to wait for them to charge me. So again here we go, I decided let me stop in for some sushi. They sat me on the top side said my waiter was coming. 15 mins passes and no one came. So today I gave up! I actually walked out and they told me have a good day. Didn't even notice that I wasn't even offered any type of service! Not even water. As I'm walking down the stairs i see 3 ladies and all of them staring at there phones. One is sitting at the round table blond hair girl, her text must of been better than trying to make some money off of me with that huge smile she had on her with her head down onto the phone. Back to one of my other visits with a co worker she also agreeed that the service was terrible and commented that our waiter on her last experience was a no show and decided to stop by the bath room and she was doing her make up. We laughed and decided let's hit the rest room before we leave and we were still waiting for our checks. Sure enough guess who was there! Our waitress putter her lipstick on. Lol! I'm actually officially done with that place. I've meet the owner once and she's a nice lady! You need to fire everyone and gather a new team. The front of the house is what holds the foundation of a restaurant to bring customers back. I and many people I know don't go back because of the service. I wish you guys luck. Today my bill could of easily been 60 bucks since there was no happy hour but instead I paid $16 for two sandwiches at jimmy johns down the block. So actually thank you for Turning down my business saved my self $44."
