jon, 3 months ago, 2, 'Terrible- put no onions in the notes and even called to confirm and she confirmed she saw the notes . Of course they put a ton of onions. So careless so i had to throw it out and waste money. Terribly packaged drink spilled all over the boxes just so carless all around would not order again - to many great places in hoboken that actually care.'

John Coviello, 4 months ago, 5, 'Been living in Hoboken for over 4 years and just ordered from Pico Taco for the first time. Ordered 4 tacos - fish, al pastor, barbacoa, and steak. They were all equally amazing. Best bang for your buck and they have 1/2 off for Taco Tuesday!'
Sebastian Coe, 5 months ago, 1, "Went the other day for some horchata, which I was excited about since it's hard to find in the area. Gosh, what I got was pure slime, if I had tasted it in the restaurant I would have given it back. I tried to water it down and mix it at home, but there was just no way to salvage it, just plain awful. They should save themselves the grief and take it off the menu."
Ryan, 5 months ago, 1, 'Went into Pico Taco at 9:35am and was told "Sorry we just opened". Lady working wouldn\'t even take my order because they were open, but just not ready to start selling food. Advise for Pico taco. Change your opening time to later in the day if your workers can\'t get the restaurant ready in time'

Jeannette Calle, 7 months ago, 3, 'The birrias are good, but the consome is bad, tastes like canned hot dog chili, and the steak tacos are tough and flavorless. They have got to change their consume recipe and quick'
Tina, 8 months ago, 5, 'Hands down amazing!! We ordered the Birria tacos and they were 10/10!! This was our first time trying this place and it was on a whim, best decision we could‚Äôve made. Honestly we can‚Äôt wait to go back'
Karen Wang, 8 months ago, 5, 'It‚Äôs the perfect place to grab a few tacos, sit outside, and people watch. The al pastor and fish tacos are a must get!'
kamath psk, 8 months ago, 5, 'Loved the baja fish tacos!! üíØ\nI would have loved to eat the tacos immediately because the fish was not very crispy by the time we got home. But the flavours complemented each other beautifully. There was crunchy cabbage (I think it was cabbage lol, not sure), some delicious sauce, the fish was cooked beautifully! I ate mine with the green sauce(jalapeno I think?). The orange sauce (habanero I think) was a little too spicy for me, it also had a sweet undertone.\n\nI got 2 tacos! They were very filling! I definitely recommend the fish tacos at Pico taco.'

Alexandra Auth, a year ago, 1, "Ehhhh. Not sure why there are so many rave reviews. We ordered the Al Pastor, Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos. They delivered 1 Al Pastor and 2 Carne Asada. Annoying but not a huge deal. The Al Pastor tacos were more Chinese food type chunks of pork with little of the delicious spicy tangy pineapple flavor they should have. The Carne Asada were also not that juicy grilled flavor you'd expect. The meat had tons of fat all over the pieces which made it really hard to swallow. The chips were good but definitely won't be ordering from here again."

Aubrey Murfy, a year ago, 5, 'Taquerias are hard to come by especially if it‚Äôs a very good one. I tried all of the tacos already and I recommend the steak, chorizo, and chicken. I give it a five out five stars.'
Georgina Edionseri, a year ago, 5, "Pico Taco is awesome. Great food and great service all at a super affordable price! When we were able to eat-in, the environment is a nice place to grab lunch with your friends or coworkers. The style is a southwestern, Mexican vibe. The food is made-to-order and made with love! I've never had a bad taco there. Also, the observe TACO TUESDAY and celebrate with half-off all tacos!"
Melanie Tam, a year ago, 4, "*Quarantine Delivery Review*\n\nInstead of ordering our usual sushi delivery, we decided to go with some tacos because it had been a while since we had some. And of course, our favorite thing to do is order too much food for two people. Here is everything we ordered:\n\nAl Pastor Tacos - these were great. Flavor was perfect and they don't skimp on the meat\nChorizo Quesadilla - you really can't go wrong with chorizo or quesadilla\nBaja Style Crispy Fish Taco - this was my favorite of the group but probably also because I love fish tacos. The piece of fish in each taco was big, which I appreciated because I hate when taco spots give you the tiniest piece of fish and fill the rest of the taco with veggies\nCarne Asada Tacos - this was my least favorite. The meat was a bit chewy and it was also bland\nCarne Asada Fries - again, the meat wasn't great but the rest of the toppings were good. I normally don't like soggy fries but somehow, the soggy fries worked here. I'd like to see an al pastor version of the fries.\n\nOverall, everything was great (aside from the carne asada). I'd definitely order again. I think I'll try out their tortas next!"

Cherri Lam, a year ago, 1, 'Ordered three tacos there first time. The steak taco was super blend with ZERO seasoning and the meat was TOUGH! The carnitas was ok but still under seasoning. Their taco shell was soft but oily.\nLong wait.... even there wasn‚Äôt a lot of people.'
