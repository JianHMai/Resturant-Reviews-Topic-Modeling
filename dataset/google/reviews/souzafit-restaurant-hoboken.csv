Cre8tive Mojo, a month ago, 1, 'I had the tropical salad with honey mustard dressing was good but a little bland and smoothie which was good but not the best I ever had. Unfortunately the main person working kept bothering me to leave a google review for free drinks. I originally gave a 4 star for free drinks but he didn‚Äôt think was good enough and then charged me for the drinks! Food is good but people are so pushy and very unprofessional and pushy about reviews! for review!  so unprofessional I will never come back because of this!'
Craig O'Sullivan, a month ago, 5, 'Had the Cajun Salmon Wrap with quinoa and sweet potato fried totaling 500 cal, 43g of protein, and 41g of carbs.  The food is quality and seems cleaner/leaner than the average quick service restaurant.  One of their differentiating factors is that they list the nutritional info such as the metrics above.  Staff is friendly as well.'

Xavier Beaudet, a month ago, 5, 'I love this place! I found this place a few weeks ago, and I‚Äôve been getting lunch multiple times a week here since. The food is healthy, delicious and affordable with good portions. The staff is very welcoming! I‚Äôm trying everything on the menu one at a time, but my favorite so far is the Souzafit burrito. If you‚Äôre thinking of grabbing a meal here, I‚Äôd definitely recommend it.'
kk greg, a month ago, 4, 'Great service very friendly people!'
David Werner, a month ago, 5, 'Love this place. I come in here several times a week for lunch/dinner. Delicious protein shakes and awesome healthy wraps (must try the monster wrap, fire), not to mention the early 2000s hip hop music videos, great vibes. Staff also couldn‚Äôt possibly be nicer!'
britney ellis, a month ago, 5, 'This place has the most amazing and healthy food that is always of the best quality! My fianc√© and I easily eat here 4 times a week for either lunch or dinner. Great smoothies and wraps. Definitely worth a walk downtown to eat here!'

Ian, 3 months ago, 5, 'One of my go to places to eat in Hoboken.\nHigh quality ingredients\nBig portion size\nLots of meat/protein\nFriendly staff\nI recommend the chicken quesedilla.'
Karen N, 4 months ago, 1, 'They need to wear masks, especially during the time of COVID to protect the local community. Prices are steep for what you get. The strawberries and kiwi fruit are so sour and they are very skimpy with serving sizes (it‚Äôs like cutting up not even 2 strawberries for an entire fruit bowl‚Ä¶) which I know they can‚Äôt control easily but at least figure out your produce problem if that‚Äôs what the meal is all about. I‚Äôd head to Piki Poke up the road next time for their acai bowl.'
Jeffrey Becker, 4 months ago, 5, 'Great food and great service!  Some of the extremely weak complaints featured here are from people who have nothing better to do than complain.'

nycentral tours, 4 months ago, 1, 'Horrible food and disrespectful service.'
Angela Frid, 5 months ago, 2, 'I feel bad writing a negative review because they had such friendly service and I have worked in several restaurants. I didn‚Äôt realize until after I already paid that not a single staff member was wearing a mask which seems not only unsafe for the customer but contrary to their healthy lifestyle branding. The cajun salmon wrap was tasty but the salmon still had the skin on.'
X Boone (The FiG), 5 months ago, 3, 'Shout out to souza fit for making  a Medium rare burger close to well and dryer than whoopin coughss The menu is super dope, really detailed and I love the fact that you can see the stats of your meal like boxing games. The shrimp tacos were the best part of the meal and yet I am STILL not full. Get regular fries.'
Michael M, 5 months ago, 5, ''
Michael Rufino, 5 months ago, 4, 'The food was fantastic, the staff was friendly and helpful, but what made the experience even better was that the resturaunt lists the calorie and macro content of most dishes. This is extremely beneficial for anyone on a diet, or those that are a bit more conscious of what they intake. Unfortunately, Souzafit does not detail any of the nutrition facts past macros, leaving out the sodium and sugar content. It also does not list the calorie count of sides or of specific plates. If those two things were addressed, then this would be five stars, for sure.'
Bryan Hricay, 6 months ago, 5, 'The staff at SouzaFit are amazing, they treat me like a VIP every time I dine here! Tasty, healthy, and reasonably priced. Plus they provide the "macros" on the menu if you\'re tracking what you eat.\n\nRecommend the barbell salad with chicken and protein coffee to give you an extra jolt!'

Helder Rodrigues, 6 months ago, 5, 'In response to Alee, while Google reviews the negative dispute which has nothing to do with the quality of their food or their business model.\nI\'m sorry to hear you had a bad experience at their restaurant. I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that they have not done anything illegal or unethical. The withhold of your last paycheck because of the key and staff apparel not being returned is very common in most business. No business owner wants to have a non-employee with a key and alarm code. It\'s a safety issue. Christina reached out to you for two weeks, asking you to return the key. They had to take measurements to protect their assets and business after you informed about the loss of such and clearly showing a immature and irresponsible behavior. Your statement about them being "miserable" is very unfair and untrue. Felipe and Christina are both hard-working people who care about their business and their customers -- you should know that they often work 12-14 hour days without taking breaks just so they can keep up with all of the orders coming in and making sure all 3 locations run smoothly as possible! Always on the road and commuting over 45 to 1 hour to assist the staff in anything they can.\nThey\'re always looking for passionate and committed individuals to help service the community. So, please do reach out if there\'s any other way to solve this matter because they have community support that can back it and a negative review will be reviewed and we won\'t let these behaviors after their day-to-day.'
Gabriela Medina, 6 months ago, 1, "They dont even count the calories the right way so if you think you're eating something with 300 calories you might be eating 700 or more. I dont recomend this place"

LBHM Hoboken, 11 months ago, 5, "I love it I've been eating it for three days the black bean burger was to die for .Definitely will keep ordering great portions .and tasty ."
Andrew Price, 11 months ago, 3, "Pros:\n- Food was decent.\n- Service was fast.\n\nCons:\n- They add on a credit card fee. No warnings on the menu, or signs in the store. It leaves a bad taste to be charged without knowing beforehand.\n- The cashier pulled his mask down to talk to me and while he was on the phone, the chef had his mask off half the time while cooking.\n- They had indoor dining. Didn't look like 25% capacity, because I don't know how they could fit in 4x the chairs outside of the pandemic.\n- Their bundled ketchup sachets included HFCS, which is disappointing for place advertising healthy food."
