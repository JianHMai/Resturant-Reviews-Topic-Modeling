Saskia Salak, a week ago, 1, 'Donâ€™t order through Ubereats. Our order was missing half the items and damaged. When we called the restaurant to inquire about the missing food they informed us there was nothing they could do to address the issues since we hadnâ€™t used their platform. Pretty terrible customer service.'

N Busch, 3 weeks ago, 2, 'Had good first order but following orders were disappointing. When I called with an issue, was passed to three different people who were not particularly helpful. They have an extensive menu and some things are tasty but it is hit or miss.'

Nicole Blank, a month ago, 2, "I really want to like this place. When they get our breakfast orders correct, the food can be well prepared and delicious. Unfortunately, our orders are wrong 50% of the time. Bacon, Egg and Cheese - arrives repeatedly with no bacon. Ask for avocado on a sandwich, get charged a buck for the avocado, but receive none.\n\nThe issues happen on phone orders and in person orders, and it is so frustrating. After a couple years of this, I've finally decided to never go here again. It's just not worth it for the major mistakes which keep happening. I'd rather have a worse tasting sandwich from somewhere else with all of the correct ingredients."

k j, 3 months ago, 1, 'The worst restaurant in the world how do you not put utensils in the bag with a breakfast order. I called the restaurant to speak to the manager the lady lies and says the manager is not in and tells me it says no disposable items in the bag .... like thatâ€™s not even an option... I will never order from them again not even napkins were put in the bag ....also there was hair in what they gave us as a fruit cup... disgusting ... do not eat from this restaurant. License and inspection should close this place completely down to check what else is on this restaurantâ€™s food. $60.00 order down the drain.'
