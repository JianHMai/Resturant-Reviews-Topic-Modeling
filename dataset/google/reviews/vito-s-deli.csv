In my opinion, they have the best mutz in town- ultra fresh, and they have it in the smoked variety as well! I have tried their chicken cutlet sandwich with fresh mutz, marinated peppers and pesto and it was just so spot on, especially with the perfectly crisp Italian hoagie roll it came on. The Soprano sandwich (same concept except switch out the chicken with some fresh, hand cut Italian meats) also knocked it out of the ballpark for me. EVERYTHING is good here, so come.'

Placed an online order and it was cancelled because they “don’t take any orders during the last hour of business.” I’ve never heard of such a thing, awful business model.

My vegan daughter loved the marinated artichoke hearts & that the veggies were on a bed of marinated arugula.  The pepperoni was shaped in a rose pattern.  Phenomenal personal service & presentation.  Thank you for a special family experience, Danny.'

First and foremost I don\'t care what anyone says they have the best MUTZ (Mozzarella) in Hoboken...sorry Fiore this is not intended to downplay other good businesses, but these guys are the real deal.\n\nI work for Citibank and we had an event for my employees where I decided to work with the best deli in town and I have always got catering from them for my teams Christmas parties.\n\nThe owner and his son are awesome and I asked them if they could do a sandwich in the shape of my business name, "Citi." They said they would make it happen for me. My employees, my boss and people from other branches even came to my office to visit because they heard we got food from Vito\'s.\n\nI was a business banker before being a branch manager and let me tell you this place is ran very well and produce such good quality. Their pasta salad was delicious, every sandwich we tasted was so fresh and you could tell they make their food with such care. I could go on and on, but I want to thank Vito and his son Danny for being professional and making food that makes you feel good. If you’re in Hoboken check it out.'

Melanie Tam, 4 years ago, 2, 'Vito\'s is a little overpriced. I ordered the Parma, (which is prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, basil, and Italian dressing) along with a prosciutto rice ball and my total came up to $16. The sandwich was just okay, and it was on the smaller side. I think I prefer M&P\'s, because their sandwiches are bigger, have more ingredients, the mozzarella is creamier, and it\'s cheaper.\n\nMaybe I just didn\'t get the right sammie at Vito\'s, but I would be willing to give it another try - especially since the staff is so nice. Probably during their "happy hour", which I believe is Tues - Thurs from 2-6, when they have discounted sandwiches.'

Justin Levine, 6 years ago, 4, "Without getting into too much detail, I had pick up 17 sandwiches for some very hungry people at Stevens Tech, and since this was the nearest of the old school Italian delis in Hoboken, I decided to come here.  The place looked like a modernized version of Fiore's, with a constantly long line to match.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the full selection of items was second to none.  Although the sandwiches won acclaim from everyone who got one, I'll stick to commenting on what I got.  I got a special with mixed grilled veggies (eggplant, red and yellow peppers, zucchini, and portobello mushroms), homemade mozzarella, tomato/lettuce/onion, garlic spread, and I also added some homemade roast beef.  The bread here was by far the best part, as it was delicious and perfect for a sandwich.  The mozzarella was great (not quite as good as Fiore, better than Lisa's), as was the roast beef.  The veggies could've been better however, as the grill gave them a generic smoky flavor which obscured their normal flavors.  Also, they went light on the veggies, as I also saw with one order I placed for a regular veggie special.  This was a great sandwich, and while its not the best I've had even in Hoboken, it is definitely worth a special detour."
Tiffany Moy, 7 years ago, 1, "STAY AWAY - DO NOT COME HERE!\n\nI purchased a $5 for $10 coupon through LivingSocial for Vitos. Right before it expired last week, I went to visit Vitos to use it but they were closed all week long for vacation. They were opening the deli back after the coupon expired (suspicious, right?). Thinking that they'd honor the coupon the following week since they closed their establishment for a full week without warning. Well that was not the case. They only would honor the $5 I paid for the coupon. This was not only disappointing since I go to Vitos all the time without a coupon but this not my fault as I couldn't use the coupon before it expired since they closed the deli!!! They should have honored my coupon - instead of throwing a fuss, I just used the stupid $5 I put in plus a little more (b/c i just wanted to get a sandwich and get out). I will never come here again and spend a penny here. I will tell all my friends, family, coworkers and anyone else that will listen in Hoboken, Jersey City, and New York City to NEVER come here. Instead I recommend going to Fiores on Adams st, M&P Biancamano on Washington, or even Tony Bolognas on First - they have better sandwiches anyway.\n\nHow dare they pull a fast one on their customers like that. They have absolutely no respect for their customers. Yes, I used a livingsocial coupon, but they also forget customers like me come to Vitos many times without one. Way to retain your customers Vitos. You should learn some retention marketing and maybe also get some lessons in customer service.\n\nNEVER EAT HERE!!!"
MLB MLB, 7 years ago, 5, "We went on a Sunday for lunch - the place was packed with a line out the door.  When it was our turn to order I mentioned how busy they were and the gentleman behind the counter said it was always this busy....so they must be doing something right, right?  I had the Sinatra Hero and my daughter had the Vito's Hero - both were excellent.  For dessert we each had a cannoli; my daughter's first.  We totally recommend this place…and will visit again."
