Andrea Alcalde, a year ago, 2, "I was so looking forward to liking this place, we have friends that order sushi from here and have recommended this place to us in the past. We arrived around 8:30pm on Friday night, so not too crowded, got a table for two after a couple of minutes and proceeded to order right away. We wanted to try the pad Thai and a couple of sushi rolls, nothing special, we ordered the chicken pad Thai, the Hoboken roll and the rock shrimp roll. They definitely forgot about the sushi order. The pad Thai came out and the sushi took another 15-20 min to come out. Two simple rolls, not a crowded place, no apology, this really ruined the experience for us. The pad Thai was pretty bland, but is not a Thai place, however the rock shrimp sushi seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way. Not as crunchy as you would expect. Overall the food was not good either. Service and food thumbs down. 2 star review because parking was super easy for Hoboken"

GREAT lunch deals on sushi - three rolls (generous portion!) with miso soup and salad comes to $16.25 (dec 2019).\nDon‚Äôt particularly recommend their hot dishes - such as rice and noodle dishes - they are just ok (eg pad Thai is soupy, not authentic). Bento box during lunch is a good value if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre craving for, but again, it‚Äôs just ok.'

They play ridiculous pop music like we‚Äôre on a club and have snowflake and stars decor on their ceiling (I‚Äôm assuming those were from Christmas) so no extra points for ambiance.'

Bonggo and Patrick Moore, 2 years ago, 4, "The decor is pretty much what you would expect for a stip mall restaurant. Our waitress was very friendly, though the front desk could be friendlier. It could be because there was a LOT of take out and delivery activity. We went early on a Friday evening, and  the restaurant itself wasn't very crowded. I had a simple meal, but the spicy tuna roll stood out. It wasn't all that spicy, but they added some kind of crunchy tempura thing to it that I really liked. Will definitely come again."

Took your standard 45-55 minutes during prime dinner hours.\n\nWe ordered the sushi for two (assorted sushi, eel avocado roll, and rainbow roll), which comes with two salads or soups. I wasn't a fan of the eel avocado roll but that's only because I don't like eel, so I can't hold that against Okinawa. Other than that, everything else was good.\n\nWe also ordered the Okinawa salad, which was tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna with seaweed salad and radishes. I was expecting more of a 'salad' but in reality, it was just seaweed salad topped with chunks of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna, with a few pieces of radish haphazardly thrown in there. But at least the fish tasted fresh, so that's all I really care about.\n\nThis seems to be the least expensive/best deal in the Jersey City/Hoboken area, so I would definitely order from here when that sushi craving hits again (which is pretty often!)"

The chicken was dry (most likely pre-pkg , heat & serve).   The chicken was served over snow peas, very few mushroom slices and red onion (lots of red onion).  The red onion was over powering in both amount and taste (hot).\nI called to let them know I was unhappy with the entrees.  The manager was very apologetic and offered house credit, restaurant policy.   I was able to get a refund of the entrees instead.\nWe were specifically looking for Teriyaki.  Most reviews has this as a top spot.  Guess that maybe for the Sushi.'
