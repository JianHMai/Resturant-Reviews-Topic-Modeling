Samantha Cagman, a year ago, 1, 'After ordering from GFG on Door Dash yesterday and my partner and I enjoying the savory breakfast, I placed an order again today. When my driver arrived for pickup he called to tell me they weren’t accepting orders, so I called to speak with the manager. The manager told me they “weren’t on Door Dash for 6 months because they were losing money”, even though as I said, I ordered and received that order via the same app just yesterday. Sir, if anything, you’ve been losing money because you’re in a location dominated by office buildings and for 6 months no one has been at work. If anything, it’s people like me in Jersey City spending $25 on breakfast via delivery that have KEPT you in business the last 6 months. Once I’m back at work, you can be sure I’ll no longer be getting my breakfast from GFG. Check out Prato Bakery or even Panera for breakfast instead of wasting your unappreciated money here.'

Allan Lazenby, 2 years ago, 4, "Nice staff, and really convenient. Breakfast is decent, and coffee was decent.\n\nThe only real problem is that I got a vegetable plate for $12, and it contained moldy cauliflower and green beans and I was still hungry. Not a great value proposition when I can walk a block and get something better for cheaper.\n\nUpdate: I've had breakfast here a few times, and it's been really good - especially the egg sandwich I just got done scarfing, so I'm going to add a star. The original review points still stand, especially the staff - they're always great."

The taste isnt there. After having been to Greece I cant say this is greek from Greece. The flavor is bland and doesn't scream authentic greek. It looks amazing and photographs beautifully but doesn't taste like that. When spending this kind of money I would expect better. They have a great vibe going in the restaurant. Everything else is 5 star except the most important. Dont bother ordering the frappe here it is entirely too strong and not even made correctly."
