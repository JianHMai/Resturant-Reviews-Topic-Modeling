Andre Cotto (Trustdre), 10 months ago, 4, "Went with my 13 year old, at first we thought the portions were small but after eating it turned out it was plenty and the food was very good so quantity versus quality it's worth it. As far as Covid rules I think the table could be a little father apart and the menus should be cleaned in between handling of different customers. We did enjoy out time. They get get a lot of togo orders and are more focused on that, I can see why. Good for take out and customers and owners. I recommend it, sure I'll go back in the future."

I didn't like the way the staff don't greet you on the way out but seem to look the other way.\n\nVegetarian options are very few and honestly don't look appetizing at all. Pho isn't hot enough to cook the bean sprouts. The beef is already pretty well cooked in the soup. Soup itself doesn't feel well done enough.\n\nBut it is hoboken so I am not expecting a lot to begin with."
Meghan Salviejo, 3 years ago, 1, 'If I could give 0 stars I would. The customer service here is awful. I ordered a B3 lemongrass beef with spring roll vermicelli noodles and extra vegetables expecting it to be a traditional, commonly known Vietnamese dish. Instead I got Chinese mixed vegetables in oyster sauce dumped on top of vermicelli noodles. I called in to ask for a replacement/refund only to be told I was the one who ordered incorrectly, and that the dish has a "stir fry." Since when have Vietnamese vermicelli dishes had Chinese stir fry on it? She then proceeded to tell me to just take the vegetables off and was unwilling to compromise. I\'ve never had such a horrible experience at a restaurant before. They can\'t even call themselves a Vietnamese restaurant. Definitely lost a loyal customer who has been ordering for 2 years. Don\'t waste your time or money on this place.'

The broth could have been hotter but overall, I was pretty happy with my decision to try this place out. My boyfriend and I came around 3 pm on a Saturday and there weren't many people dining - probably because it was a weird hour, and it was also the Saturday before Halloween so people were probably busy prepping for their parties that night. We also tried the banh mi, which was okay.

Here, what I got was a hot beef and pepper stir fry over what seems closer to hot spaghetti pasta, with a little pile of lettuce next to it. What a disappointment. The stir fry was tasty, despite being a bit oily for my taste, but just wasn't what I was expecting. It doesn't seem this is a typical Vietnamese restaurant- wouldn't go here if you are looking for the light fresh and delicious food the cuisine is known for.

Keith Jackson, 5 years ago, 3, "Decent place. Only ordered from here so can't comment on the atmosphere. Would like to see a little more flair or ethnic flavor I the food."
amruta chintawar, 5 years ago, 2, "The vegetarian pho didn't have any taste. Just veggies in clear soup. May be other broths are good."
Stephanie Tom, 6 years ago, 4, "When I'm sick and in need of comfort food, or when it's a terrible cold and gray night, I turn to Phonomenal. While it might not measure up to what you can get in Cali or even Flushing or Chinatown, it's surprisingly good Vietnamese food. All of the workers are also very nice and I've never had a bad service experience.\n\nA tip: if you get a bowl of pho, whether ordering online or in person, make sure you get the beef bone broth. That has the most flavor and true umami taste."

Angelo, 6 years ago, 1, "Terrible experience. The chicken skewers were burnt. The lettuce and sliced carrots didnt taste fresh. My pregnant wife ordered their pad thai and didn't like it. She had one bite and that was it. They still charged us! Lady telling us it's their policy to charge even if we didn't eat it. Whatever happened to the customer is right and showing good faith and professionalism. Never coming back! Try Rice Shop down the next block, so much better!"
Peter Kalliney, 6 years ago, 5, 'The Pho and vermicelli were great. The prices are very reasonable and the food is excellent. On top of all of that, its BYOB which makes it a gem.'
Frank Deste, 7 years ago, 3, 'Nice but needs more flare food OK also'
