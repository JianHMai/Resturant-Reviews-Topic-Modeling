Gabriela Emiliano, 4 months ago, 3, 'I personally did not have a good experience at this place. Nobody sat us down, and we had to notify the restaurant twice that we were outside ready to be served.

I have never been in a restaurant with such a poor time management. I loved the scenery but it was not worth it.'

I got a selection of the rolls that were also great! The staff is attentive and friendly I wouldn’t hesitate to come here again! The only drawback that I saw was the interesting choice in decor. It wasn’t bad or seemed cheap, it just seemed like the decor of a traditional american seafood restaurant and not a sushi spot. Regardless the food was good!'
