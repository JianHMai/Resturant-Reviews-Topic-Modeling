Iesha T, 8 months ago, 1, 'I should‚Äôve listened to the reviews. I ordered 2 juices and an acai bowl. My acai bowl came frozen and I had to let it sit out for a few to defrost.. a juice was missing and when I had called to let them know they told me to just get a refund thru Grubhub. They didn‚Äôt even care to call to let me know they were out. Won‚Äôt be ordering from here again'

Sky gem, 11 months ago, 1, 'Wish I could give zero stars! This place is terrible and dirty. They don‚Äôt wash the fruit and to make a smoothie they quickly rinse a dirty blender with water and a dirty sponge.

Brian Arcos, a year ago, 2, 'Would rate lower* didn‚Äôt get to try any a√ßa√≠ but the smoothie was terrible. Any respectable place that sells smoothies shouldn‚Äôt put CANNED DOLE pineapple juice in a smoothie. I literally would‚Äôve been happier with a watered down smoothie. Please never put canned fruit into ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù smoothies. But yeah, the smoothie tasted like back of the freezer months old frozen fruit and a sugar overload from Dole. Up the price of smoothies if it means using quality ingredients.'

Brandon Stoll, a year ago, 5, "I have been going to Acai Ya Later for 2 years now, almost every day during the week. (my office is right down the block).   I have had all of the different spots in town (Shaka, Pitya, you name it, i've had it) and the Acai bows at Acai Ya Later are in a league of their own.\n\nThis might be my first review ever, but I felt obligated to let them know they do an amazing job.  From how they prep their fruit and acai, to the friendly service I will continue to go every day.\n\nPro tip, Acai Bowl, with granola and a healthy amount of almond butter.  Honey, blueberries, mangos, and strawberries with coconut flakes on top.  I ate one 4 hours ago and am drooling writing this.  I will see you all tomorrow!"
Becky A, a year ago, 1, 'I‚Äôve had two bad experiences, the first was with a smoothie, it wasn‚Äôt blended properly there were chunks of ice and spinach that I had to chew. The second was with an a√ßa√≠ bowl, it was ready within 2 seconds after I ordered it so I immediately knew it wasn‚Äôt fresh or going to be good. The a√ßa√≠ was frozen and tasted like ice at the bottom, it‚Äôs supposed to be smoothie texture, they just threw on everything else and it tasted like it was sitting for a while. How hard is it to make a fresh bowl for each customer? I dont really understand why they have to pre make the bowl it‚Äôs gross, wont be back at all I‚Äôve had way better'

Ayan Castro, a year ago, 1, 'This is definitely the worst pitaya/a√ßa√≠ bowl I‚Äôve ever had. Everything is just frozen and not fresh. The pitaya is just ice and they put a drop of Nutella. Also the service was terrible. I ordered online and they said my bowl would be ready in 40 minutes. 20 minutes go by and I figure that it doesn‚Äôt take that long to make a pitaya bowl so I go to pick up my order. When I double park in front of their store the girl working there is just standing there on her phone not doing a single thing. I walk in and ask for my order and that‚Äôs when she finally got off her phone and actually started working. Afterwards I realize she gave me the wrong order too. Ended up throwing them away. A√ßa√≠ ya later more like a√ßa√≠ ya never'
Maria Rodriguez, a year ago, 1, 'Worst bowls ever. Huge disappointment. I ordered a pitaya bowl and it is basically like an Italian ice, a slushee pretty much. That to me shows that they are cheap. I don‚Äôt know about anyone else but when I order a pitaya bowl I want it to be smooth, not freaking ice. They definitely just blend it with water instead of blending it with a banana or something. Anyway, please save ur money and go somewhere else. Really wish I can get my money back. Oh and also got my order wrong.'

Erick Cameron - Music, 3 years ago, 3, 'I have been going to this A√ßa√≠ place for quite some time. Their A√ßa√≠ bowls taste great (I get the Berry Me Baby w/Nutella). However the only reason I am giving them 3 starts is because they are not open when they say they will be. I have driven 20 minutes multiple times to get a late night a√ßa√≠ bowl and everytime I get there, they‚Äôre closed (or closing). They have posted on google and their door that they close a 10 p.m but FYI if you are craving a late night bowl, get there 30 minutes before hand because they tend to close 15-20 minutes before 10 pm.'
Brett Hladczuk, 3 years ago, 3, 'I was so excited about my bowl with bananas, strawberries, peanut butter, nutella, and granola, until I realized half of the bites were dryer than an unaroused desert, and the other half were frozen, less than delightfully tasting bites of acai. Acai Ya Later references my thoughts when I left this place for good.'
Sarah K, 3 years ago, 5, "Great food, friendly staff in a cool neighborhood that gives you small town feels in a big city! The Acai was good - just sweet enough but not too sweet, with a creamy texture. They are also generous with toppings which is nice because everyone likes toppings in every single bite and that's what you get here. Highly recommend topping your bowl with almond butter as its fresh and nutty flavor compliments the fruity sweetness from the rest of the bowl perfectly!"

They claim they open at 7:00 AM breakfast time for me, yet I've driven past countless times past 7, 7:15, 7:30, and today 8:00AM and they still weren't open. No phone number is listed on google so I can't call ahead to check either.

Brianna Kennedy-Beal, 4 years ago, 1, "First, I wanted to create my own pitaya bowl, but they told me that they were out of pitaya until Monday. They said they only have frozen pitaya, which is used for the smoothies and is like a popsicle.\nOnce I settled for an acai bowl, I was asked what fruit I want, but was not given any options. I usually get strawberry, banana, and kiwi, so I went for that, but they didn't have kiwi either. Again, I settled for something else and took my bowl to-go.\nBy the time I got home about 20 minutes later, my bowl was completely watery. The acai mixture that was used must have been water based and frozen as well, because the texture lacks any substance at all. The mango was really slimy and not fresh and the banana tastes off as well.\nAll that is really required to make a acai bowl is to put fresh fruit into a blender, a hard thing to mess up. From my experience, the only fresh ingredients seem to be some of the fruit toppings. These bowls are expensive for what they are; customers should expect fresh fruit for this price. I will not be returning"

I just came back from South Beach and they have these type of shops everywhere.  In comparison, I feel as though this Hoboken location the Aca√≠ was icy (like old, freezer burnt ice cream).  Maybe it was an old/at the bottom of the barrel scoop or perhaps different brand?  I'll try once more to see because I really would like to support better health businesses."
