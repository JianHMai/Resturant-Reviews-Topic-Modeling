Klutch, 7 months ago, 5, 'Sadly, COVID forced them out of business.\n\nThey were one of the better pizzerias in town. They had big slices at a good price.\n\nThere are a lot of superficial people in Hoboken and I think the outside appearance of this business made people overlook it and not spend money there.'

j g, a year ago, 1, "Rude and bad customer service. First time and last time customer here. This happened like a year ago, or a year and a half ago, (I know it's a little late review, but why not to share it?) Long story short: when they charge me, (I think it was $8.50) they didn't had coins, so instead of rounding the money down, they round it up to their advantage, so instead of charging me $8, they charge me $9. Of course, they asked me if I have change, but I didn't. I had no time to argue, so I just gave them the $9, and leave. I know that 50 cents its not a big deal (and thats why I didn't argue, plus I was in a rush) but its the action. If I were the owner, I would ask the customer if they have change, and if he don't, then I will charge him 50 cents less; not 50 cents more. What a piece of trash those people are."

Brian Pierson, 2 years ago, 1, 'This place is an eyesore and embarrassment  to the town - from the appearance outside to the quality {lack thereof} inside. It must be able to remain in business for one single reason . . it‚Äôs next to a park. And their core clientele - amped up toddlers - would eat cat food if you called it pizza. Boy, someone really just needs to bulldoze this dilapidated pile of rubbish and start all over. Or maybe, accidentally, flick a lit cigarette into the grease canisters that line the outside of the building. Rating: 7 Stars / if 1 is the best and 7 is the worst.'

Brian Pearson, 2 years ago, 1, 'Is this place for real ? I thought I was in the middle of a candid-camera episode when I accidentally stumbled into this filthbox. I still say there‚Äôs no way this is a legitimate pizza shop with actual paying customers. The only thing older, dirtier, and more dilapidated than the outside of this place - is the inside. The pizza is  nearly inedible, the sandwiches are mostly bread, the employees are sweaty and miserable . . the most enjoyable part of my ‚Äúmeal‚Äù was the Snapple; which itself wasn‚Äôt very cold in the half-broken fridge. Let‚Äôs be clear: there are literally dozens of pizza places in this town. Maybe there‚Äôs 30 . . in which case 29 would be better than this dumphole. Seriously: why would someone knowingly choose to eat here - because it‚Äôs 7 Stars ? Maybe so, 7 Stars on a scale of 1,000 Stars. This place is BAD. Real bad.'

Esteven Santiago, 2 years ago, 1, "Worst experience ever I ordered my pizza then it was a 30 min for delivery. Then I waited call again ask about my pizza . The guy at the phone said that he called and no one answered. Which my phone ever rung. The pizza was in his car on his phone and said that no one was there. I was waiting in the rain wet for it. He sent the driver again and saw he asked him delivery he said yeah . I saw you before and you saw me here waiting why didn't you ask me if I ordered pizza. Then he had the gut to say I was calling you. Took my pizza and paid him. Never again will order from this place. Plus my pizza was cold .worst place to order."

Service is always quick and friendly too. However, I will say that the crust is subpar and pretty bland. A little salt in the dough, which I've seen being made fresh, would go a long way."
