Supratik Hajare, a day ago, 5, 'The California burger came out really great. Great place to hangout with friends as they have got some seating area. Although they have small bar area , its a cute bar . Outside seating makes it worth while as well. Their decor for Halloween was great too.'

Anne Brewer, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'We were visiting Hoboken from Philadelphia and were so happy we decided to stop in for drinks here! Nick the Bartender was fun and charismatic, and makes a pretty darn good dirty martini! Plus, as two girls originally from South Jersey, it was nice to chat with someone who was also originally from there too!\n\nMy friend lost her contact and he even helped her make an eyepatch. We’re convinced he’s a doppelgänger for Ben Affleck. We hope to be able to visit again soon!'

Once the food came out one of the burgers was raw (after ordering it medium) so we sent it back to be cooked more. They took 30 minutes to recook the burger and at that point the other people in the group had already finished their meal. Only thing that was done in a timely manned was the waitress bringing the check (with raw burger on the bill). Will not be back again.'

Good bar selection.\nCan honestly say that if my coworker and I (we were on a business trip) lived in the area, that would be our hang out.'

Krystle Henley, a year ago, 3, "Management needs to review the steps of service with staff and work on professional attitudes. You can't treat customers the way we were treated last night. It's unprofessional. One of the servers seemed like she wasn't in a good mood and was annoyed with us from the second we got there. She cleared the table and at one point shook off my friends fork from the plate. Then we got our food more than an hour later (struggled to finish our meals at that point) and then 20 minutes after we got our food someone was trying to clear our table."

I remember I had the Pear Goat cheese Salad, good flavor I will just recommend to add more than 4 small balls of goat cheese and pay attention to the cherry tomatoes since 3 half had mold on it. Every place deserves a second chance so we will go back again and see what happens. With the time it will be nice if you can spice up the tables across the street to make it a nicer place to eat :)'

Mr. Neil, a year ago, 5, 'Best wings (Buffalo & Sweet Chili) in New Jersey, hands down. They recently repeated their win for best wings in Hoboken too. Outside of the wings, the food is excellent overall.'
Eric Hammer, a year ago, 5, 'Five stars for this casual, cozy Irish pub. BEST WINGS IN HOBOKEN.\n\nI\'m very particular with my buffalo sauce. I find that a lot of buffalo sauces are "sweet", which is typically not what I prefer. I tend to lean towards the more savory/spicy sauce. Carpe Diem has a sweeter sauce, and I STILL think they\'re the best wings in Hoboken.\n\nAs good as the wings are, it\'s quite the opposite with the fries. The buffalo wings are remarkable, and the fries are remarkably underwhelming. No biggie, plenty of other things on the menu. Plus it\'s all about the wings.'

It’s great when you walk into a bar and the bartender knows your drink order and you don’t even need to be a frequent visitor.
