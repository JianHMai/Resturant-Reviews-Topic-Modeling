So naturally, the food took some time to come out. It‚Äôs a unique menu and vibe that just feels so wonderfully small-business like and we really enjoyed it.

Gemma Kim, 2 years ago, 1, "I visited here many times as my go-to place. I always find the staff to be very friendly and hard working in general but every few times I encountered the owner at this place, I just felt very un-welcomed and intimadated to stay. The look and the way you are treated by the owner and the whole vibe of the Cafe just changes a lot when the owner is around. I've been quite a regular customer despite the fact that I've experienced such an unpleasant treatment from the owner because the staff and their food are actually ok. But i really don't think I will be going back anymore.. I do not post any reviews but this time, the rudeness of the owner's service was just really unbearable."

Ahmed Shehata, 2 years ago, 1, 'We ordered crepes, a salmon omelette, and coffee. I enjoyed the coffee and crepes. The salmon omelette tasted fishy and I could tell it wasn\'t fresh. It also tasted like they spilled the salt in it. The waitress should have amended my bill but she didn\'t, so that is why I am rating this two stars.\n\nUpdate: Sadly, I did not want to have to come back to this, but I must defend my character and warn other customers. So I called later because the salmon did not sit in my stomach well. I am grateful to have not finished my food because from taking a small bite I felt nauseated. If I ate the entire thing, I do not know what would have happened.\n\nObviously, it is within a customers right to not pay for bad food. Further, I only asked to have the salmon taken off the bill, and not anything else which is generous being that the fish is bad and ruined my appetite. Neither did they offer to bring me some other entree. This comes down to my word against the owners word, but please look to other reviews for similar complaints to further corroborate this experience. Please scroll through the questionable 5 star reviews to common complaints. Also, please refer to the owners nasty response which is indicative of shoddy service.\n\nIf you look at my review, not once did I insult anyone. The owner took it upon their self to call me "disrespectful", "spoiled" and even question my "consciousness". The owner does not know me to make these quick character judgments. Just because you order salmon every week does not verify your claim that my order was good or fresh.  Why would I leave a tip? For being being insulted or eating salmon that made me feel unwell?\n\nMoreover, when I called to let them know  she became verbally abusive and threatened to she. If you could afford a lawyer you can afford to amend my bill. She told me over the phone that I was taste sampling local businesses. This is not true either. I was happy to take my friend to another restaurant where we enjoyed the food and happily paid the entire bill with a tip. Over the phone the owner did not handle my complaint effectively and was verbally abusive.\n\nAccidents happen all the time. Sometimes food is bad and sometimes that is out of our control. It is hard to run a small business. However, the part you could have controlled and failed at miserably was the customer service.  All you had to do was fix the issue by amending the bill and not insult me and I would not have written this review.\n\nEquating my fair critique to leaving a nasty review is just a desperate attempt to defend bad behavior. You have my number to apologize and you can still amend the bill, then all will be well. I would be more than happy to update my review and let everyone know that you apologized.\n\nAt first, I rated this two stars, but now I am changing it to one for the dismal customer service. Simply, as the owner has made clear, it is not about the customer experience here.\n\nPros: Friendly staff, good coffee, and crepes.\n\nCons: risk of being insulted by owner and getting sick from the salmon\n\nIf you\'re okay with being called names, then this the cafe for you.\n\nUPDATE: The owner deleted their response where they insulted me'

No need to look at the menu, I chose salmon...and from there asked maybe a salad and a cookie as well? Yes to all, sat comfortably with photos of the Lackawana R.R. up with good music on. The meal presented was a full plate, delicious salmon, fresh greens, peppers, olives, sauces, cucumbers, a croissant, and rose flavored water. A peanut butter cookie for final and all hit the spot tonight. Cozy special corner here in Hoboken. Go, especially for dinner.'

Umang Mistry, 3 years ago, 1, 'I went to this cafe based on the reviews and my experience turned out quite the opposite..as soon as we were seated our eyes started watering and there was a strong smell of onions in the air..it was so bad that we could barely keep our eyes open. We saw that the other guests seated there were all facing the same issue, so we pointed this out to the gentleman serving us and he just flat out told us "we are free to leave if we want because there\'s nothing he can do about it". When I told him that all the guests were having the same issue, he rudely turned around and asked the guests at another table and when they confirmed it, that\'s when he turned back to me and apologized and went back to the cooks to inform them. This was such a bad start to the entire experience that it just left a very bad taste in the mouth(metaphorically) and thereafter everything that we ordered, just did not taste any good. We were tourists from Virginia and had come to NJ/NYC for the first time and we came to this cafe for brunch solely based on the reviwes, but after this experience we\'re NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN!!'
