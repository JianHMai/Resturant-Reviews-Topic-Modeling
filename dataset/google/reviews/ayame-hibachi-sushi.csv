They always have to go orders ready in 10-25 minutes and a huge menu to choose from with amazing special roll options.

The fish was good - fish to rice ratio was perfect. This special came with your choice of soup or salad. I decided to go with the "hibachi soup", which has scallions and mushrooms. It\'s pretty salty, so you\'re better off getting a miso soup or just a side salad. Prices are on par with other Hoboken sushi spots. Is it amazing sushi? No. Will it suffice if you\'re craving sushi? For sure. Would def order from here again.'

Jason Schlusser, 7 years ago, 1, 'Victim of own success.  They keep forgetting parts of order and this last time basically said screw you we are too busy to bring what you paid for.'
T. Pisani, 7 years ago, 5, "My favorite sushi place. The rolls are made very well and always have a ton of fish even if you order for delivery. The appetizers and specialty items are very unique and the menu has actual pictures of their food and not generic items so you know exactly what you're in for. I've never done Hibachi but I won't go anywhere else for sushi now."
