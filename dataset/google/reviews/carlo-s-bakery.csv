Kelvin Daigle, an hour ago, 1, 'I stay in St. Louis Missouri I’ve always wanted to try cakes from this location so once I found out that DoorDash was delivering the slices of cake I decided to order five of the slices of cake but upon delivery two of the cakes were not correct and one was missing  and the cakes tasted as if they have been refrigerated for a few days I contacted DoorDash and they said they could not replace the items and they can’t  refund it so I was really disappointed in my first experience with this product I’ve always thought it would be better than what it was but I guess you always have to try something once to get a full experience and I wasn’t satisfied with my experience I thought it would be better than what it was but the Cakes taste  basic'

It almost make me run  from that place. in 2nd I was still excited for try my dessert and can’t be more disappointed instead to be fresh and crunchy the lobster tail was soooo chewy and absolutely Not fresh.

Ryan Murphy, 3 weeks ago, 1, 'I, like a lot of others, was really excited to visit the original Carlo’s when I was in the area. I had been to the location in Dallas and I was disappointed in the quality and the selection, but I thought surely the original would be better. When I got there, it had the same overly commercialized feel as I remember at the Dallas location. It was over priced. I paid nearly $30 for 4 cannolis and 2 lobster tails. They were pre-boxed. A voice in the back of my head told me I would be disappointed again, but I bought them anyway. When I got them home to Los Angeles later that same day, the cannolis were soggy and had a strange taste and the lobster tails had a tough, ropy texture that was hard to chew. The filling also had a weird taste. So, I echo other reviews that say that quality seems to not be what you’d expect. I was disappointed. I had walked by another “ma and pa” bakery on the same street that in retrospect, I wish I’d gone to.'

I immediately sent a response, answering all the questions and letting them know the date of my mother's 90 birthday (October 2) and that I really wanted to make the day special.  I gave them a reference number from the cakes on their site, told them colors, said that I wanted it two tiers and the type of decorations.  After waiting for 5 days for ANY acknowledgement, I sent them another email.  Still no response.\n\nThis is my mother's 90th birthday.  During the last year of Covid deaths, we have lost so many of our elderly and I wanted to make this event special.  Buddy and his team can't even be bothered responding.

The cake was pretty but extremely small. It arrived on time but even after letting it thaw three hours, it was still frozen so we ate it the next day. Working in a famous bakery in the past, I've come to expect much higher quality of cake than what I received. The cake was made with American buttercreme which was extremely disappointing. I was expecting Swiss or Italian buttercreme which is much better quality. There was so much of the American buttercreme icing it was sickening and no one got through the cake slices presented to them. Will not be ordering from them again. You can find much better cake out there for less made with higher quality ingredients. When a bakery uses American buttercreme, it shows that they are merely trying to make a quick buck, sacrificing quality in the process. Not worth the money. The two stars are only because it was able to be shipped, arrived on time and was pretty."

I was hoping to meet Maddalena and Mauro because they genuinely seem like the nicest and humble people but no family, I guess it’s the weekend or they are all in Lackawanna lol.\n\nI would’ve wanted to have more options but unfortunately there weren’t. Can you believe an Italian bakery but no tiramisu 😱😱😱😱😱! I decided to buy the famous lobster tail, crumb cake and a slice of chocolate cake and chocolate chip cookies. To each its own but I prefer my lobster tails with a fluffier filling and the lobster tail itself to be bigger. The chocolate cake smelled delicious and it was good but thankfully the crumb cake saved the experience because it is DELICIOUS!\n\nWe didn’t spend more than 5-10 mins in there which is great no wait time but it’s not the inviting and happy Carlos bakery I love to watch on tv. Hopefully, if I decide to go again, I can have a different experience. Crumb cake five stars, experience 2 stars.'

The rainbow cookies tasted processed and the chocolate chip was overly salty. Also tried a slice of cake and the cream has that processed sugar taste.

So much effort to drive that far, get everyone out of the van and in the rain to only get to stand at the door and be turned away due to a lousy mask order.

Connie Xu, 5 months ago, 4, 'While this cake was priced extremely reasonably, I will have to admit that the cake itself was a little underwhelming. Really, the cake was moist but the frosting was just too thick. The frosting that covered the cake cracked as I was slicing the cake, which could be because the knife wasn’t sharp enough but it wasn’t the greatest thing to look at. Perhaps it’s all the hype around this bakery that made my expectations unreasonably high and overall, I don’t regret my purchase! My mother loved the cake and the cake survived the one hour car ride home. Now let me tell you… this cake may seem small, but my little family of four ate just over a quarter of the cake in one sitting. We couldn’t make it through the rest! Overall, I would say buy the cake for occasions if you are in the area… if not, I’m not sure how much shipping a cake would cost, but it might be worth it to look at bakeries closer to you. The sole reason I didn’t give Carlo’s 5 stars is because I think the frosting is too sweet and too much, but that’s of course a personal preference.'

Jason Silva, 7 months ago, 3, "I'm a big fan of the Cake Boss, and Buddy is a big reason for my home baking. But I'm also born and raised from Brooklyn and have been exposed to Italian bakeries my whole life. I was surprisingly underwhelmed by the pastries at Carlo's Bakery. I tried the Lobster Roll, which I was inspired to try when he made them on Buddy vs Duff, but they were half size of other bakeries (at the same price) and tasted average. I had a similar experience with flavor when trying the cannoli and Cheesecake. I was also surprised by the lack of other pastries common at an Italian Bakery, but I can only assume that it's a business decision to only carry what sells in the neighborhood. So if you live in the neighborhood or are visiting Hoboken, Carlo's Bakery is a good place to quench that sweet tooth. But as for a must go spot I recommend other places in Brooklyn and Queens first."

Joshua Ewers, 11 months ago, 5, 'Ordered a cake for my wife’s birthday (shipped from NJ to TX) and it was legitimately one of the best cakes we’ve had. Can only imagine how good it’d be straight from the bakery. Purchasing, shipping, and delivery was a breeze. Would definitely order from here again.'

This year i purchased cookies from Carlo's via goldbelly. They arrived today and we immediately opened the box. They taste AMAZING!!!! SO FRESH, like they were baked this morning.  I will have to order more since I know between my 4 boys these will not last until Christmas! Thank you so much for making our Christmas so special this year and for making cookies that are beyond compare in quality and flavor!"

Evan Sun, 11 months ago, 5, 'The lobster tail is delicious as mentioned in the reviews.. this was my first lobster tail.. I recommend it.. the outside is crunchy and the inside is cream filling.. the cannoli was good too.. creme was not overly sweet which I like.. a good experience and the price was average for a bakery.. It was $18 for everything I got.. no lines when I went.. I recommend trying at least once'
