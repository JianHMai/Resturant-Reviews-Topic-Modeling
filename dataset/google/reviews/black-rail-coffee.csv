alexa stone, a year ago, 1, 'I was thoroughly disappointed in the way I was treated at this establishment and HIGHLY request that they consider disability training with their staff.\n\nI had a trained service animal necessary for my daily function in a clearly labeled vest. Immediately upon entering they told me he could not be in here. I apologized for inconvenience but told them I cannot be separated from him. They asked for ‚Äúidentification‚Äù which is not required by law. They asked why I have him with me. I am not required to disclose my disability. I gave them an Americans with Disabilities act card and ordered my food and drink, tipping 25%. My service dog laid calmly at my side the whole time. They asked ‚Äúto go?‚Äù I apologized and said I‚Äôd be working there. And they said ‚Äúwe have an outdoor area for that.‚Äù Not only is it cold and the middle of February, but I let them know I needed an outlet and rather than letting me sit where I chose, though there were many seats open in the large establishment, they told me to sit in the very back corner, even moving a customer to do so.\n\nWhen they called my name for food I was not allowed to go to the counter to pick it up, they belittled me by forcing me to stay seated because they didn‚Äôt want myself and my dog approaching the counter.\n\nI wanted nothing less then to leave and not support this business any further, but I stayed to work in order to show them a service animal has every right to be in an establishment. Toast laid quietly under the table for the 3 hours we spent here, sitting up once to perform a task. We did not receive an apology.'

Frank Deste, 6 years ago, 2, 'I think the people that work here write their own reviews. Actually the place itself is not bad, but the people that work here have to have more customer friendly skills.I was greeted the other day with " what do you want boss!" Now I don\'t know is the is derogatory or not bit I take offense to that term means something or not  but I did take offense to it. I am not this guys boss but it is sad that I got treated like a jerk...i will never enter this place again...'
DG KIM, 7 years ago, 5, 'Awesome place!!! Tried all of their sandwiches and each of them are all uniquely delicious and I bet you will come back for more to try the different yet creative sandwiches they offer. If you are getting tired of eating any other regular subs/sandwiches, then this place is a must go for you. Also dont forget to get the ice coffee, very smooth and good quality tasting ice coffee, unlike those cheap one dollar coffee you can pick up anywhere else.'
nick piergallini, 7 years ago, 2, "This place isn't a bad place, but their prices are unreasonably expensive for what they offer. If you want to spend $4.25 on a 16oz iced coffee that is NOTHING special, go here. I would rather spend $3 on a Starbucks trenta (30oz) coffee."
