Catherine Z, 4 months ago, 5, "I live close to several liquor stores, but I will go the extra 1/2 mile to get to Delite Liquor because of their service and selection.\n\nI've gone to places like Sparrow and have asked them to call me when certain wines/drinks come in and they never follow up. Sparrow will also say something is out of stock without helping me look, only for me to find it a few minutes later.\n\nThe service is also 10x better than other stores in Hoboken. They are kind, give you the time of day, and are incredibly helpful. Delight will not only call/text me when my selection has come back in stock, but they will also hold special drinks if you ask them too.\n\nBest liquor store in Hoboken by far."

He makes everything so easy! So happy to always shop local and small. It\'s so nice when an Owner extends that personal touch and goes the extra mile for his customers. With Harry, I would even call customers, "clients." I have a favorite variety of wine and he is always willing give me the heads up when it\'s in stock. Check out Delite. You won\'t be disappointed.'

Brian Pierson, 9 months ago, 2, 'Why does your store refuse to show the prices for all of the items you peddle . . like any normal business ? Is it so that you can easily manipulate and overcharge customers ?\n\nAn honest response is eagerly awaited - though not expected . . as this has been inquired about for awhile without any fix.'

The selection is the best in the area as well in my opinion, during the holiday season they always stock a variety of new seasonal craft beers which is great especially if you are in the mood to try something new. I always stop here to buy liquor to pre-game prior to hitting the local bars since its right on Washington St. They also deliver which is super convenient if you dont feel like walking over!'
