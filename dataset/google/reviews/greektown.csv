As soon as you walk in you feel at home by their greeting to you.  Service was impeccable thank you Hamida!  The food in a word FABULOUS!  Started with the Chicken Avgolemono soup which I must say is the best I have ever had.  We love Greek food and there is nothing in the area that could satisfy or even pass for decent Greek until finding this place.  Honestly, you MUST stop in and try this soup.  We also had the Greektown Chips- fried zucchini and eggplant with a little grated cheese and a side of tzatziki.  The combo of the grated cheese and tzatziki on the little fried slice is just delicious.  Next we had to try a traditional Yeero, very yummy, fresh, great portion and again that fabulous fresh tzatziki.  I had the pork chops with greek fries and grilled veggies.  nice hard grill on the chop, I squeezed the lemon on top which they had on the plate and it was quite nice.  Grilled veggies were tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant and red peppers and it was really good.  The greek fries were crispy and cooked perfect.  The only thing I would add is more lemon to the plate which after being here I know Hamida would bring you a plate of lemons if you ask her to!  Overall extremely satisfied we finally have a Greek place we can go to.  They also deliver yay!  We will be back, very memorable'
