J R, a day ago, 5, 'Been a few times and loved it so much I did a private birthday event here. Truly one of the best restaurants on all levels; The food, the service, the ambiance, the attention to detail...all is top notch. Highly recommend for a date, a drink, and even a large 20+ event, I’ve done em all and will do it again. A prime example of a perfect hospitality establishment.'
Michael Gebo, 3 days ago, 5, 'Excellent restaurant! Certainly a top 2 or 3 in Hoboken. Went with another couple and sampled several appetizers and we each had different entrees. All of the dishes were flavorful and delicious. Everything has a healthy bent to it. They have done a really nice job on the design/atmosphere and friendly, attentive service. Going to be our go to restaurant!'

N Busch, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'We had such a wonderful first meal at Olivia’s. Our outdoor table was comfortable, the waitstaff was excellent. Everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully plated. I tried the Hoboken Life cocktail which was delicious. The guacamole and fried artichoke hearts were both tasty appetizers. For mains we had the steak, lobster & shrimp spaghettini and vegan bolognese. Everything was so good! The green beans and mashed potatoes were excellent. We shared the passion fruit tart and guava ice cream - beautiful, natural flavors without being heavy or overly sweet. We can’t wait to return and try more dishes.'

Amir Zeenreich, a month ago, 4, "Let me start by addressing what would probably be the main complaint by future reviews - the price.\n\nIf you're looking for a 'bang for your buck' type of experience, there are other restaurants in Hoboken that can offer that.\nHowever, if you're looking for high end dining that doesn't fall short in quality and creativity (and yes, prices) than the best restaurants in Manhattan - this is the place for you.\n\nMy wife and I had 3 starters (fried artichoke, filet mignon tacos and the mushrooms and eggplant balls) and we would have eaten the plates, if these were edible. Everything was simply DELICIOUS!! The portions are not very big but but also not tiny that you feel you've gotten the short end of the stick.\n\nThe cocktails are also on the high end of the scale price wise, but they're very big. We've had the red sangria and the Unrequited Love and they were both great (mind you, they're also very strong).\n\nI'm taking one star off for being seated next to the kitchen and for the horrible acoustics that made me scream all night to wife. But I was mostly screaming that I love this place and that we'll definitely be coming back!"

Mark Hansen, a month ago, 4, "The food was super delicious! Absolutely loved our appetizer and main courses. The cocktails were also well made and used high-quality alcohol. The inside seating was quite tight unfortunately, it kind of felt like we were on a double date with the couple next to us. Worth a visit (we would go again!), especially if you can go at a time that isn't too busy."

Patricia Reid, 2 months ago, 1, 'This place is a joke!  Booked a reservation at 515 a week ago and specifically asked to eat indoors. They kept telling me that they would do their best to accommodate us when I kept saying that my husband could not eat outdoors. It was supposed to be my birthday dinner but I was getting extremely anxious that they would not seat us indoors. Thank God Manhattan is so close.  This place has growing pains. Been to the finest restaurants and have no patience for this.'
MG Gro, 2 months ago, 5, 'Oh yummy! Had chicken, shrimp and pasta. And some sharables ( fish spread).  Sat outside and enjoyed the warm night.  The food was absolutely fabulous.  The water was extremely helpful, patient and friendly.'
Danielle LeBeau, 2 months ago, 1, 'Do not come here if you have any food allergies, it is not safe. My husband and I sat down for drinks and clearly told the wait staff that I have an allergy, not just a dislike, and to please confirm if these menu items are safe. Without hesitation we were told yes and food was ordered. I was definitely skeptical at this point because the answer came with a confused look on the waiters face... After putting the food down, we confirmed it was dairy free but I still asked what was in the sauce. The waiter left the table and came back to tell us that "yes" there was an allergen in the sauce. blown away how careless this was... this is not ok and so disappointed.'

Justine Schepis, 2 months ago, 5, 'One of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Our food was great and the presentation was also. We had guacamole (amazing!), steak tacos (amazing!) and the flat iron steak (amazing!-the manchego mashed potatoes were the best mashed potatoes I’ve ever had). Our server Milton B was excellent! Very knowledgeable of the menu-food and drink. He gave us great recommendations! We had a great evening!'
Alexandra Henriques, 2 months ago, 5, 'Amazing meal and ambiance! The duck tacos were great, and so was the lobster pasta.'

Hiral Trivedi, 3 months ago, 1, 'Went for my birthday and had the worst experience ever. When I got there I told the host I asked for outside sitting and she kept arguing with me that you never asked for it. After checking her chart, she agreed that it was outside sitting. Now, I had no table for almost half an hour of waiting. Host said she needs to set up the table for us. Once table was set up she told me table is crampy for a party of 5. No rule following of 6 feet between tables. Felt like they were doing me favor giving us a table. No service or hospitality at all. I felt very unwelcome and unwanted. Heard so much about this place but will never recommend anyone to go there. Their business is running because of patrons like us. Ultimately, I declined the crampy table and headed out somewhere else. Olivia, step up your hospitality and get rid of your attitude.'
Claudia Deriy, 3 months ago, 5, 'Food was delicious. Ambiance was great. Drinks were the best.'
Denise Foster, 3 months ago, 4, 'Good food. I had the Spaghettini which was quite tasty although the lobster was a little chewy. My waiter was very attentive and provided very good service.\n\nI gave it 4 stars because the hostess was rude and inpatient.  I went there yesterday Sat 7/31 on a whim. She wanted to seat me inside but with the AC full blast it was chilly.\n\nSo I asked if there was anything available outside.\n\nThere are two tables that are almost on the street I didn’t want to sit there.  So I asked again if there was anything else outside.\n\nShe said no everything has reservations.\n\nI went early on purpose .. 5:30.  Then I spotted a table by a nice corner and asked if that was ok.\n\nShe said yea you can sit there and threw the menus snd left.\n\nWith the prices they charge their hostess needs to be on point.\n\nI will go back as I live right on the block and as I mentioned the food snd waiter service was pretty good'
Antoine Tessier, 3 months ago, 1, 'Wanna be Manhattan restaurant, very loud. Food is ok nothing fantastic. Price is high for what you get.'
Scott Clarke, 3 months ago, 1, 'I’ve only ever written one review before and it was exceedingly positive, so I hope that shows how strongly my wife and I felt about this experience. I’m shocked to see all these five star reviews on here, because our anniversary dinner was absolutely horrible.\n\nThe first thing you notice is it is far too loud in there. Mind you, we’re young people so this is typically not something we comment on, but between very loud music, packing tables into the small space, and horrible acoustics, you’ll end up struggling to hear someone screaming across the table from you.\n\nShockingly, the restaurant seems over-staffed. There must have been 20 employees in the dining area. Even with this, the service was horrible. While our server was very very nice, it was clear he didn’t know what he was doing. We ordered drinks, then he came back before they arrived to take food orders. After the decent drinks arrived, he took our order. We ordered appetizers and entrees. The apps arrived and were nothing special. My wife loved a chip that came with the Mediterranean spread (which is actually just a small jar of whitefish salad and olives), so I guess that’s something.\n\nAfter a long wait with empty drinks and waters, the waiter finally came back, pen and pad in hand, asking about entrees. He clearly forgot to put them in. He seemed confused when we ordered a second round of drinks. At that point, he must have put our entree orders in, not that he ever said anything or apologized. After an extremely long wait (we had our phones out looking for availabilities at other restaurants) the exceedingly underwhelming entrees arrived. Bland would be an overstatement. We ate what we could and asked for the check. This was the first time we got prompt service all night as the waiter brought the check over immediately. We brought home the sides; maybe our two year old will like them.\n\nWe are very tolerant of growing pains for new restaurants, but the club-like atmosphere, forgetting to put in orders, and blah food are just inexcusable. Sadly Olivia’s didn’t just fail to become a new local favorite (we live just down the street), but in almost 8 years of living in Hoboken, last night, our fifth wedding anniversary, may have been the worst dining experience we’ve ever had.'

Tom Koty, 3 months ago, 2, 'Meh. Good food but hard to enjoy a luke warm steak. Slow service, disengaged server. Basically, he took our orders, then didn\'t return again until we asked for the check. No dessert or coffee offered. Took an early reservation because it was booked solid, then the restaurant opened 15 minutes late?\n\nGave it a 2 because:\nA) Not a single aspect of our meal or service that made us go, "Wow! That was cool/unique/fun/delicious." (We\'re not that hard to impress and make happy).\n\nB) I\'ve had worse experiences and food.\n\nIf I could break it down:\nFood - 2.5 stars\nAmbiance - 4 stars (cool space)\nService - 1 star'

Jade Briggs, 4 months ago, 5, "Me and my family had Olivia's for my birthday and I decided to get the grilled lamb. It was amazing! It was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My kids enjoyed the crispy shrimp with a side of fries and my daughter had the chicken strips and fries. The chicken strips and fries were a very large portion for kids she was able to save some for the next day. I called in a few days later to place a carry out order for the lamb but was disappointed to find out they don't do carry out orders."

Robert Lurie, 4 months ago, 5, 'Really incredible. Cocktails are simple but really good and refreshing. May not think of guacamole when thinking Mediterranean, but guacamole is really good. I the skirt steak and my wife got the pork chops and both were incredible. They gave us a passion fruit tart to finish the meal and it was fantastic.\n\nOverall, great addition to the area. Service was quick but not overbearing. Great outdoor seating, and indoors look nice. Brunch service will be starting soon, looking forward to be back for dinner and brunch.'

We visited Olivia for the grand opening with my 5 year old ("Olivia") who has been anxiously waiting for the opening of this restaurant for months.

The ceviche and the churrasco are outstanding, drinks are great and the dessert is delicious!  Our compliments to the Chef who has such a talent! We look forward to visiting this restaurant many times!'

The waiter answered any questions we had about the menu and continuously checked on us through out the night. We got the guca, croquettes, and grilled octopus for starters and they were pack full of flavor! We also got the salmon and steak for our entrées and once again did not disappoint. Cooked perfectly and decent portions. And their cocktails were on point! Lastly we got dessert and that was the cherry on top with the tres leches and lemon tart. Highly recommend checking this place out, will not disappoint.\n\nThe ambience inside was great and they had live music from a talented singer! Just added to the overall vibe.'
Jonathan Pepe, 5 months ago, 4, "Olivia's is a breath of fresh air in town. It's a cute space with trendy touches. The staff are great and very warm. The latin fusion cuisine is all well prepared, presented, and most importantly...tasty! Cocktails were on point as well. Fried artichokes were great, as was the 3 bean hummus. We'd recommend them both, although the sauce accompanying the artichokes was addictively good. Patrice's chicken was a gorgeous presentation and preparation. My churrasco was top notch though the plating was a bit slapdash. We wrapped with a lovely lemon tart which was surprisingly elegant. The espressos that accompanied did the job but they weren't a highlight. Wine list is to-the-point and has plenty of accessible options. Overall 4 stars, quickly rising to 5 I hope. We will definitely be back."
