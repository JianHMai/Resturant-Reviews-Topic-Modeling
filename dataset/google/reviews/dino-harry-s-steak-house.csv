Anastasya V, a week ago, 4, 'I really wanted to love this place all the way. It was cool. It was packed when I got there. Reservations definitely should be made. Ordered the porterhouse for 2, medium rare. Came out more medium. Had a bottle of Caymus and the entrees. Server was awesome but the check had way too many charges that weren‚Äôt even part of our bill. Cash is cheaper than credit. That is stated in the check.\nDefinitely good quality food but not my first choice for food. It was nice but I don‚Äôt feel like I got the best service.'
Audrey, a week ago, 2, 'Underwhelming experience. The steak quality was not prime grade (especially for the price) and many dishes were over salted. The waiter we had was not attentive‚Ä¶ was strange because we ate early and it wasn‚Äôt crowded yet. Disappointed because there are many good reviews and we went for a special occasion. Indoor ambiance had good vibes.'

johncz100, 3 weeks ago, 1, 'Terrible service. I really wish Hoboken had a solid steakhouse and Dino and Harry‚Äôs could/should be that spot but it‚Äôs not. The steak is often not cooked propped and the service leaves MUCH to be desired. They act as if they are a Michelin rated restaurant as opposed to a standard steakhouse‚Ä¶which is disappointing'

His response: "I wouldn\'t know. I only go to restaurants I can afford to pay for."\n\nWow... surprised to say the least. His arrogance was unreal. Great food, never again for me.'

Brianna Strzezek, 2 months ago, 1, 'If I could give 0 stars I would because they don‚Äôt even deserve 1. WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN? Came here for my boyfriends 30th birthday and the night went south FAST. Dino has a fantastic piano that my talented boyfriend decided to get up and play and the whole restaurant was loving it. Next thing we know Dino (the owner) comes over slams the piano cover on my boyfriends hands and screams in his face ‚Äú Do you know who I am? I‚Äôm Dino, get your hands off my piano.‚Äù For context he did this to my boyfriend in front of the other 17 people we were with and made a huge scene in front of the restaurant. The way we were addressed was absolutely disgusting and so embarrassing for an owner of a restaurant to talk to us like this. He ruined the entire night.  Fortunately for Dino we took our business elsewhere. I absolutely do not recommend this place and I cannot comment on the food because Dino screamed at us before we even ordered any food. If you are looking to get on the piano at dinner Dino and Harry‚Äôs is NOT the place for you!'

Onion soup was just OK and lacked the depth of flavor one would expect for the price and at this caliber of dining experience.    Cod was excellent, although the sauce lacked character or much flavor.  Key lime pie was presented beautifully but was a bit too sweet and lacking in lime flavor.  I might go back and try their steak next time.'

Geomar Sanchez, 6 months ago, 1, "Made a reservation to celebrate my fianc√©'s birthday. I was looking for a nice vibe with good food. Instead, I was placed at the worst table in the restaurant and when I asked to be moved, I was placed outdoors where the main attraction, the piano player, was inaudible. Next, our server was not friendly and seemed to be in a rush. When we kindly asked for 5 more minutes, they disappeared to the point where we had to reach for their attention. Finally, we hoped the food with be up to our expectations considering this place is NOT cheap. Instead, we were stuck with a burnt 'well-done' steak and a bleeding 'medium-done' ribeye. The overall experience was terrible for a such a nice place in a prime location. At certain points it was nearly impossible not to take the service personally considering we saw other tables with white patrons getting the customer service that we expected at this price tag. I've been to other upscale steak houses in the Edgewater area with 10x better service and food at the same price point. Needless to say, we won't be coming back here again nor do we recommend this establishment."

My date had the blackened Salmon with heirloom tomatoes, she loved it. I had the Rigatoni with spicy sausage and it was delicious and filling. The greeter, wait staff and others were all attentive and professional. I was able to reserve and pay for parking in advance online. It was a block away."
Nick Frangipane, 7 months ago, 2, 'The young hostess was rude. I ordered food for pick up and arrived 10 minutes early (usually food is done before the ticket time) she looked at me with no expression in her face and said your ticket said 6:45 almost shoeing me away. Maybe tell the customer this " your food is not ready, if you\'d like why dont you grab a drink at the bar and ill notify you when its ready". Additionally their steaks are not dry aged. It was like a thin shoprite steak cooked well done not mid rare . Not worth the money.'

Frank, 7 months ago, 3, 'The filet mignons (ordered 8oz medium rare and 10oz medium) and rib eye (ordered 24oz medium) were good. Would have been much better if they were cooked to the correct temperature. We ended up with 8oz medium and 10oz medium rare and ribeye 24oz medium well. When you spend $165 on three steaks, you expect them to be cooked correctly. We were very hungry so we ate what they served us.'

Finally after several attempts to resolve the issue we received a reduction in our bill along with more excuses and continued poor service.

Melanie Tam, a year ago, 4, "It was my fianc√©'s Dad's birthday and we were looking for a last minute dinner spot after Augustino's gave our table away. We found a reservation for Dino and Harry's so it was perfect - we've been meaning to check it out anyway. It was MLK Jr. Day so it was pretty empty at around 6 pm.\n\nTo start, they brought us the best bread basket ever. It included hot/freshly baked rolls, bread sticks (the crunchy sesame ones), and flat bread crisps. It was nice that they provided a variety. For food, we ordered a bunch of things to share amongst four people. We ordered the Scallops (roasted cauliflower, Pearl barley with a morel mushroom sauce). The scallops were perfectly cooked but a little too salty. Luckily, the rest of the dish was not. I loved the creamy mushroom sauce. Paired with the Pearl barley, it was very innovative. For steak, we did the 32 oz Porterhouse. The menu says it's for two people but this with the scallops and two sides was more than enough for us. We even had leftovers. The steak was good but pretty oily - probably the reason why we all filled up rather quickly. Creamed spinach and brussel sprouts with applewood smoked b weacon were the sides we picked (all sides are $10 each). The creamed spinach was a bit off to me. For some reason, it tasted minty to me (it was just me though). Surprisingly, I enjoyed the brussel sprouts even though I normally don't like them.\n\nFood was good overall, service was great - definitely don't mind coming back for another special occasion."

My wife and I came here three times - each time we‚Äôve been placed in the same tight back room of the establishment, not in the main dining area. We got seated by the hostess and then immediately approached by our waitress asking for our drink orders. Having not enough time to look over the wine menu, we asked her for an extra minute to make a decision. She didn‚Äôt come back for fifteen minutes. She eventually came back and asked us for our entire order, we obliged, even though I was afraid it would throw off the order of the meal - wine, salad/apps, mains. My fears became a reality when our Caesar salad came out ten minutes before our first glass of wine. Shortly after getting our wine out came our steaks, leaving little time to enjoy either the salad or wine. What came next was a serious problem, far more disconcerting than breaking meal conventions. The steaks we ordered came on top of a bed of diced mushrooms. After a few bites of her steak, my wife‚Äôs face turned from OK to alarmed, as she began pulling pieces of glass out of her mouth. MAY I REPEAT, THERE WAS GLASS IN HER FOOD. It was difficult to track our waitress, and instead we found a busboy. He hurriedly removed the plate without an apology or clue as to what would come next. We told him didn‚Äôt want a replacement, we wanted to speak to someone. After quite a while of us sitting, fuming, meal ruined, the waitress arrived saying she‚Äôs going to comp the steak. No apology. No explanation. No offer to comp the meal. The busboy who we told we didn‚Äôt want a replacement steak came back with a replacement steak, feeding fuel to our fire, and proving the staff were not communicating and lost. There are other options for a steak in Hoboken. Take my advice and check them out first, or eat at your own risk!'

Ordered the T bone medium rare....came out and it looked good, but upon cutting into a tough piece of leather( bad cut of meat) my steak was medium/well done. I was hungry so I was going to tough it out and eat it but the first 2 bites left a bad burnt taste in my mouth. I flipped my steak over and it was black on the bottom. After 20 minutes the bartender finally asked me if everything was ok, oblivious to the fact I only had 2 bites of a $45 steak. He literally argued with me that they char the steak, and wouldn't listen that the steak was so burnt it left charcoal residue all over my plate....buyer beware this is no elite steak..Outback is better."

Christine, 3 years ago, 1, "We showed up on time for our 9pm reservation, but the bar and entrance were packed with people still waiting to eat for their 8:30, 8:15 and 8pm reservations. The staff was honestly pretty rude to the other guests waiting and it was clear that the staff was blatantly lying to them about when they'd be seated.\n\nPeople were pretty miserable, and it was clear this wasn't changing anytime soon, so we decided to try another restaurant instead. The maitre d tried to convince us to stay because it had only been 10 minutes since our reservation time. We pointed out that we had just heard her curtly tell someone waiting for an 8:30 reservation that there were still people waiting back from 8. She relented and agreed to cancel.\n\nAnyway, we had an amazing time at Lola's! Hopefully Dino and Harry's can step up their customer service soon, as I heard their food is quite good."
Jordan, 3 years ago, 2, "Food was solid.  The service was abhorrent.  Waited 45 minutes with an 8PM reservation. The hostess was not pleasant or nice at all.  After we ordered, they brought the app, but then they cleared our app early to bring our entree's which weren't ours, so we were left app-less. They forgot to bring our oysters, told them forget it, they brought them anyway.  Then they brought someone elses food to our table AGAIN.  Finally after an hour and 20 our pasta and steak arrived which were both fine.  Then when leaving, the hostess didnt even say goodbye have a nice evening or anything.  The service was terrible.  For what you pay here, I expect much better service.  Especially from the hostess how do you not greet your guests!!!!!!  Would not recommend."

The bacon was very good, seemed like it was pork belly. Fried calamari was average. I ordered a rib eye steak. I ordered medium rare but when it arrived it was well done. The waiter did not check on the table until everyone was finished so I could not inform them. Otherwise the steak was well marbled and tasted good. As more sides, mashed potatoes were average and the asparagus was good. There was live piano which was nice. I expected more quality from a restaurant like this."
