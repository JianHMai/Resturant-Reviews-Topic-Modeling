Kluma Bete, a day ago, 3, "Sunday for Brunch! We order a smoked salmon sandwich (with French fries) and open faced eggs with one Bloody Mary and one margarita. The food wasn't great, not a lot of taste. Drinks were not good, couldn't finish it. BUT great service !!"
Olivia, 3 days ago, 5, 'My boyfriend and I got the bao  buns, the ravioli and the fish.. everything was delicious!! The ravioli was a perfect Al dente with flavorful, hearty filling. The bao buns were steamed perfectly to be nice and fluffy, with super tasty filling that had a nice kick to it - without being overwhelmingly spicy. We also got a few cocktails too from the seasonal list- all very tasty.'

Ashlee Carlisle, 3 weeks ago, 1, 'Really was excited to try this place being new to the neighborhood.  The experience was not the best.  First the waitress spill an entire alcohol drink on me and it’s not about the fact she spilled something… accidents happen rather it was the way she handled it.  She did not apologize, in fact she said, did the drink jump from the table?”  When she directly set the drink down in between the gap of tow tables together and as soon as she let the drink go it spilled.  No acknowledgement of the inconvenience. Very gaslighty and did not apologize.  In fact took 20 minutes to bring the new drink out and then when my friend ordered his 2nd drink she brought the wrong drink twice, after the second time my friend just drank it.  Manager did not come to the table and apologize.  Don’t waste your time and come here. A ton of staff, slow service, rude and unseasoned food.'

Rob Dominiak, 4 weeks ago, 1, 'Good food but was not treated well by the staff. They got my order wrong for take-out, and I came back to the restaurant to rectify the situation and the chef refused to do anything about it. There was no manager on sight to talk to and the host was unable to do anything. Went back home with cold meal. Terrible customer service, this is no way to treat paying customers. Will not be returning.'

Nathalye Ribeiro, a month ago, 2, 'I understand they cannot control the sun, but they set a table outdoors quarter block away from their establishment under very little shade and did not allow us to move when I informed her my party was uncomfortable. Instead the waitress called the hostess who very condescendingly blamed us for our party being too big to accommodate - mind you we called to make reservations the day before, and called to confirm the day of. Could not enjoy our food after burning for two hours. I would advise coming as a small group -6 people max (our party of eight was apparently too much for them to handle courteously)'

Des KF, 2 months ago, 4, "So I met a friend of mine for brunch here. I made my reservations online for 12:30pm. When I arrived I parked on the street fairly quickly. I walked up and the hostess greeted us and sat us. She sat us in the corner inside and said there is a 90 minute limit for tables. Mackie was our server and she was nice. For my drink I ordered a spiked coffee drink and my friend ordered a mimosa. The drink wasn't bad, didn't taste any liquor at all. For my entrée I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the salmon salad special. My meal wasn't bad at all, I liked the waffles more than the chicken. My friend said her salad was good, she just wished there was more dressing. The bill for me came to about $31. We had a pretty decent time all in all."

Margaret Banks, 4 months ago, 1, 'One bad Appel ruined the meal!!!\n\nI decided to celebrate Father’s Day at a local restaurant( zack’s in Hoboken our server was amazing!!!\nHowever one of the staff servers was shockingly rude.she acted as if she was disturbed by our very presence at the restaurant . When we asked for out take out containers she questioned us as if we were asking for something unreasonable. Then She put her hand in our containers to count them as to make sure we were not trying to take extra !!!! and then walked back with another container slammed it on the table and walked away. First  we are coming out of a global health crisis ..second we just spent over $150 on a meal that was below average. I have no intention of returning to zacks as a black woman with my family it’s not a place that I’d recommend to any of my friends and the sad part is I think that’s the way the establishment would prefer it.'

Rad C, 9 months ago, 1, "Beware my vegetarian friends, this restaurant needs a tutorial on how to cook vegetables. Ordered the Kung pao cauliflower which tasted stale, the portobello in the portobello burger was uncooked. They charred a portion of my nachos, which I ordered without beef of course, and when I pointed it out, they just took the charred portion away. So I took the meat out, they took a portion of the nachos out, but I still paid the same price. I don't I will be going back anytime soon."

We were told it would take another 30 mins after waiting for 30 mins already because there are many people waiting before us. But as soon as we left they texted table is ready so it seems like they were not in sync about how many people are waiting and so on. The seats were too close to the street and it was a little annoying to be so close to people just walking by as you are not wearing a mask while eating. The food was decent but I am not so sure if it's worth the wait and the risk."

The chicken sandwich which they claim to be known for is simply  a chik fil a sandwich. Fries tasted frozen and the calamari tasted chewy and rubbery. The tap water was very chlorinated.(ever heard of filters?) Would expect better from a well known “top” restaurant in Hoboken.'

We ordered mussels for appetizers, the sauce tasted good in itself but the mussels and sauce did not go well at all. We also ordered spare ribs and brisket burger for entrees. The spare ribs were so horribly over cooked it felt like it was pressure cooked and came in a bland and no taste sauce. It left a bad feeling after eating with the over cooked pork fat. The only good thing in the dish was mashed potatoes. The burger buns were very dry, but marginally better than the ribs. The French fries that came with the burger was alright.'
