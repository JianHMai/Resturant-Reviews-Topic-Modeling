Kayla C, 3 weeks ago, 2, "I used to love this place but they must have changed their pastrami because the last of couple times I've gotten it, the texture was completely different. Honestly tasted like was boar‚Äôs head pastrami from a grocery store deli. I was so ‚Ä¶"
Barney Simon, 9 months ago, 5, 'Efficient pick up. Excellent pastrami.'
Nick Frangipane, a year ago, 4, "I went on their soft open. I'm happy this place opened up in Hoboken. I ordered a pastrami sandwich and corned beef. The pastrami was very good and tender. The corned beef was not as tender. I will cut them some slack being that it was ‚Ä¶"

Agent Panda, 3 months ago, 3, 'hmmm... the pictures look good both on google map and doordash. However, both sandwiches I ordered last week, are not as good as the pictures are. No cheese, no sauce, super dry sandwiches. Meat has almost no flavor. It has 4.6 stars on DoorDash, but I think the 3.8 on google map would be more realistic.'
Doris Nicholson, 10 months ago, 5, 'Great selection of products. Sandwiches are an excellent portion'
Stu The Jew, a year ago, 5, 'This place is awesome.   Best food ever  They have two types of Knisches... Need I say more ?\nThe best restaurant on Washington Street . Beyond impressive menu.'
Lisa Hoskins, 11 months ago, 5, "Pastrami sandwich is excellent. Best potato pancakes I've ever had! If I cook at home and need a side dish, I run over to Pastrami House and get the potato pancakes to have as my side dish. The giant chocolate chip cookie they sell is ridiculously awesome. Love the knishes."

Daniel Kadyrov, 6 months ago, 5, 'This place is good. I got the Hurricane which is brisket with melted cheese, peppers, and onions. It was hot and delicious. It also came with a tasty pickle and savory cole slaw. My friend got a sloppy joe which took him two days to eat. ‚Ä¶'

Em Thompson, a year ago, 4, 'Got a large Brisket Sandwich. Meat was pretty good, but they didn‚Äôt put any sauce on it! Bread was good too. Pricey as well, but good service(I didn‚Äôt wait long). I‚Äôll give them another shot. It was the first week and restaurants are still working out the kinks.'
Nicole C, a year ago, 5, 'Delicious food and friendly staff. Some sandwiches probably wouldn‚Äôt travel well because of getting soggy, but excellent when eaten on site. Unique deli for Hoboken that‚Äôs worth a visit.'
Varun Khanna, 11 months ago, 1, 'Consistently have received bad service and cold food from this deli.  After 3 poor experiences I will never order from here again!  You are better off going into NYC and hitting up Katz if you are craving a Reuben.'
CurlsnPearlsss, 9 months ago, 5, 'Best pastrami ever! Also, the cole slaw is the perfect side to compliment their sandwiches! Delish!'

David N Rosensaft, a year ago, 3, 'Pastrami is decent.  Reuben flavorful albeit a tad greasy.  Other items are creative, interesting but uneven.  Only deli of its kind in Hoboken, so if a craving strikes, this is a worthwhile destination.'
Margarita Alvarado, 10 months ago, 4, "Every item i have ordered hasn't disappointed me. Matzo ball soup is always my favorite."
evan cohen, a year ago, 1, 'Good is mediocre to good.  However, they never seem to get the delivery order correct.  4 out of 5 times me food was either incomplete or incorrect.  The gentleman who says he‚Äôs the manager is argumentative when faced with the fact that the order was incorrect.  Best to order from somewhere else!'

Carlos Prado, 9 months ago, 5, 'Good sandwich spot for Pastrami. Definitely going back'
Ryan Rasmason, a year ago, 4, "I dig this place and hope it sticks around. The only reason it's not 5 stars is my personal beef (pun intended) that pastrami sandwiches everywhere are overpriced. Don't know why that's a thing everywhere (It really isn't so expensive to ‚Ä¶"

Jason F, a year ago, 4, "Got a large hot pastrami sandwich. Bread was solid and meat was fairly fresh. They also weren't exactly generous with the portion. Definitely pricey for what you get. However, they do have a great selection of Jewish deli specialties.Being ‚Ä¶"
John H, a year ago, 1, "Got the pastrami sandwich, wasn't good, didn't taste like pastrami, wasn't on rye bread like I ordered, no swiss cheese.  I'm guessing they make their own pickles bc what got was a cucumber that was prob a few weeks from being a pickle, you get a 1/4 of a pickle buy I also paid for an extra one."
Kate Grove, a year ago, 2, 'Ordered food online (through seamless) for a scheduled pick up. Got a confirmation & arrived at my scheduled pickup time. I waited over an hour (!!) and got a different quoted wait time every time I asked the girl at the front. After an ‚Ä¶'
Ken Boyar, a year ago, 2, "I suppose I'm giving it two stars since the staff was nice and the cole slaw was decent. But the meat is seriously bad. I ordered the corned beef sandwich and the meat was tough and stringy and practically inedible. You will do better going to any local deli."
Jon C, a year ago, 5, 'Unique addition to Hoboken. A bunch of fun snacks like cheesesteak egg rolls and shepherds pie cakes.'
