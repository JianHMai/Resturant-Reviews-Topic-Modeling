Ali Brinjak-Gray, 2 years ago, 5, "I was introduced to Amanda's Bananas when they brought one of their trucks over to my apt building for a building hosted block party. I had heard of the brand before and was anxious to try. A little about me, I am currently on WW's and am someone who is always searching for a low point ice cream option that doesn't leave anything out. Amanda's has been the greatest discover on my journey! It tastes delicious, has a wonderful ice cream texture and has a great selection of toppings. I am especially happy with the portion size and the amount of whipped cream that is given. Overall, I try to make it over to Hoboken as often as I can for this delectable treat and hope you all expand in The City one day so that I can have the option to hit you up during my lunch hours. Thanks for making a great product!"
