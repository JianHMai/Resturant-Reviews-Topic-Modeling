jimmy B, 3 weeks ago, 1, 'Where to begin? You can walk all the way there and they will tell you it’s online order only even though there’s 10 workers behind the counter. But if that’s not bad enough they’re literally always out of something. Last week I went they were completely out of chips, steak, cheese, and ice in the soda machine. When I went today they were out of rice. You’re better off walking to the Jersey City location because this one is such a mess. I rarely leave reviews but this Chipotle makes me question if life is even worth living.'
Brian M, 3 weeks ago, 1, 'I rarely leave reviews for anything, but this is the 4th time in a month they messed up my order. I used to work at a chipotle and to be honest, it’s really not that hard to complete an online order especially when it’s not their peak time. Can’t say I’ll be ordering from them again'

Changwoo Ham, a month ago, 1, "I’m not usually the person that posts reviews on any places, but with the experience I had with this Chipotle today, I felt like I had to post something about it.\n\nSo I ordered a chicken bowl and a side of chips through the app and it told me that my order would be ready for pickup at around 2:20. I arrive at around 2:18 to pick up my food and my food doesn't come out until 2:30. This I understand because they were a bit short staffed in the front, but as I get my food, I find that my chips aren’t in the bag and asked the lady at the register where my chips are? To which she replies that they didn’t have chips and just told me to get a refund online. This I also didn’t care as much about because its just a bag of chips, but still pretty annoyed because my order came out 10 minutes late.\n\nAfter getting my order, I had no time to eat at the location because I had a train to catch and as I got to the station and looked at my order, I find that my order is completely wrong and the bowl looking as if it was half eaten or swept to the side because there was not enough food inside the bowl. Either way, this is completely unacceptable and I’d advise everyone to not order from this location because clearly they lack the understanding of good customer service.\n\nTLDR: Food came out late, didn’t get my chips, mediocre service, and got a completely different item from what I ordered looking half tossed around like a football"

Staff is completely unprofessional and disorganized, basically useless. I doubt they know the difference between a burrito and a bowl. This problem has become a pattern here and nothing is being done to fix it. I understand you can become overwhelmed with orders but the fact that I have experienced this as often as I have, it’s clearly a ‘you’ problem.'

Antonio Rezik, 2 months ago, 2, "Took a day to write this because I was extremely upset in the moment, and wanted to cool off. I arrived about ten minutes before closing and was waiting in a short line, there is only one young bilingual lady operating the front by herself. After a minute or so I noticed a sign on the glass between the customers and servers saying cash only. Having no cash on hand I decided to run around the corner and get cash from the atm. I returned in line behind the woman who was behind me originally. It's about three minutes before closing and the young lady starts to take my order when, who I can only assume is her manager, a gentleman with make up on comes to the front and tells me and the other customer behind me that the store is closed. The young lady attempts to explain that I was in line but had to leave to get cash, but he would not hear it and instructed her to throw out my order.\n\nI give two stars because that young lady was hustling and served the half dozen of us and fully intend on serving me and the other gentleman behind me. But the manager was rude and unwilling to listen to me or his employee. I understand having a card reader break and going cash only, but you need to understand if I have to walk two minutes to get cash from the atm in the pouring rain, the least you can do is stay open a minute or two later to complete mine and the gentleman's behind me order. I do like chipotle but will no long be giving any of my business to this location."

Elizabeth Wasserman, 3 months ago, 2, "Chipotle is chipotle. It's good..usually. This chipotle is close to my house so I go pretty often.

Luis Rivera, 3 months ago, 1, "If I could give this 0 stars I really would. This is the worst chipotle I have ever been to. The chicken tasted old, the rice was hard and the beans were a b it uncooked. To top it all of the chips we're extremely stale. This isn't the first time it has happened either but it is the last time I'm ever ordering from here. Save yourself the time and go order somewhere else trust me."
Bryan, 3 months ago, 1, 'Same chipotle, terrible service'
saroj lenka, 3 months ago, 2, 'Starts with One liner "need some cleanness and proper spaces in meat and veggies containers".\nNot sure why most of the Chipotle keep the veggies and meat containers so close and next to each other. Why they forget veggies has to be veggies, there is a chance of meat fall in veggie container while filling bowl or wraps. Chicken and meat eaters its ok, but not for vegetarians.'

Saraih Cruz, 4 months ago, 5, "I would like to give a massive thank you to the three people that were on the front working for hours on hours on end. Jaylynn, Trinity, and Lizzie, I was on line for possibly 45 minutes, they were clearly going through a rush and by the looks of these other reviews it seems like an everyday experience at this Chipotle. During that entire wait they must've served and made over a hundred different orders, yet they maintained their strong will, their kindness and understanding of the customers frustrations, and were trying to get the line moving as quickly as they possibly could. As someone who has worked in the food industry I have complete understanding of how frustrating it is for customers to try and rush you over something that is beyond your control. This Chipotle has way too many people coming into their store everyday overworking these diligent employees to the bone and I have yet to see any gratitude for these workers in reviews or in person. Once again I would like to thank those three employees, Jaylynn, Trinity, and Lizzie for being outstanding workers who deserve nothing but the best (most definitely a promotion) As well as all other employees that work for this particular Chipotle. Keep up the outstanding work and I hope nothing but the best for this location. Hopefully customers will understand and appreciate the effort you are all giving each and every single day."

I understand you make a mistake once or twice but this is now the fifth or sixth time this has happened. Poor training and poor management. If you order meat you end up with no meat. If you order a tortilla it’s missing. Sometimes you end up with a puddle of water at the bottom of the bowl like a nice soup. Yes, the chipotle app is nice to offer compensation or a free meal but then I have to order again and get the same thing happen. Wont be ordering from here again. period. Stay away folks.'

Was resubmitting the order and did not get any update on the app. 9:31 spoke to agent at Grubhub and simultaneously got a message by text from them saying the order was cancelled and refunded.\nEXTREMELY disappointed, enraged, etc about this order. NOT GOING TO ORDER HERE AGAIN and hope you don't either. The restaurant doesn't pick up their phone either.\nTERRIBLE. The system does not work regardless if it is from the restaurant itself or on another website.\nALSO, the previous times I ordered from them the serving size has been so small- not accurate and not the quality I expect from a Chipotle.

I recently gave it a visit during the pandemic because the BOGO entree deal on DoorDash got me. I ordered ahead and when I got there, I saw that the pick up orders are organized at the front according to your initials. I don't know if it's first initial or last, but just check both. Mine wasn't ready yet but I asked the cashier and they just told me to wait by the front, and it was ready shortly. This was nice because you have less people breathing around the food area (even though everyone needs to wear a mask inside). You can still order there but I don’t get why people still do this, when you can order ahead and have the food ready for you, especially during Covid age.\n\nOverall, a pretty good Chipotle."

I get home and take my receipt out of the bag and also found they charged me for guac when I didn’t have guac. I ended up just throwing the food away because I started questioning the food safety etc. The whole experience was terrible.\n\nThat’s the problem with corporate owned restaurant chains.

Instead of listening to me about my two orders, he just went ahead and started talking to them.\n\nWhen he had to remake one, he literally didn\'t even put any rice on the bowl, and at that point I was tired enough to even complain.\n\nChipotle Hoboken, teach your employees to be more attentive to your customers, because I can just go to Quality Greens Kitchen (which is right next door)'

Also the consistency on the rice isn't always there. A couple times the brown rice was underdone. However the staff is always very pleasant and efficient. As someone who also works in Hoboken the clientele can be demanding, and I've witnessed first hand the team members handle odd requests with grace. Additionally I'm willing to look past the aforementioned issues bc Chipotle is one of the few reasonably priced options for lunch in Hoboken."
