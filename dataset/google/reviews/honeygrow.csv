Anastacia Flores, 2 months ago, 1, "Food is pretty decent, I do enjoy it. The customer service is always poor, there has never been a time where I've been greeted. If I say have a good day, nobody responds. I've also had an encounter (my FIRST time here) where I did not know where something was and when I asked all I got was someone rudely sigh and point in a direction. No verbal response or eye contact. After a few encounters like this I usually order with the app and just pick up. Most recently upon ordering in person, I was reminded of the poor customer service and how rude the staff screams your name.  Do not respond to this, this is not a one time occurrence, this has been my experience everytime I have come here. The food is great, the service not so much."

Joan Espinoza, 6 months ago, 3, 'Went here for takeout lunch. Not going to lie the food was very light to your stomach and filling. I ordered a MYO bowl with noodles and apparently should have contained roasted chicken and roasted shrimp with some roasted vegetables. The protein was stone cold and the shrimp was more like the cocktail shrimp texture and like straight out of the fridge. They had a variety of other things to order. The food is enough if you eat average sized meals. Not made to share of if you have a big stomach this is not for you. Their guava strawberry lemonade was pretty good too. Decent place. A little overpriced and the servings are okay. The food needs a little more love. Everything seem to come out of a bag.'
Claudia Johnson, 6 months ago, 3, 'Truly a hit or miss. I order from here often due to it being close to my job. I‚Äôll get an amazing stir fry one day, and a burnt, sauceless stir fry the next.

Chelsea Phu, 11 months ago, 2, 'I had the BLT salad with spicy ranch dressing. I have no idea what dressing they gave me but it didn‚Äôt taste like ranch at all. It tasted like heavy cream with spice added to it. It kinda tasted like they straight up milked it from the cow‚Äôs utter, churned it to make it thick, then added some spicy stuff. I like the spice but the taste of the heavy cream that was supposedly ~ranch~ ruined the dressing and the meal. I will give 1 star for the fresh lettuce and 1 star for the abundant bacon bits. Maybe I‚Äôll order it again and hope that the dressing situation was just a mistake, then change this review. But i don‚Äôt see myself ordering an expensive salad only to receive imperfection. Also, I ordered through UberEats and was unable to remove the blue cheese. So I am typing this as my lactose intolerant stomach is tightening up. If they give me a voucher for the same salad and it‚Äôs fixed up, I‚Äôll change the review. But fix the UberEats app options :)'

Daryl Krasnuk, a year ago, 1, "I have ordered from this place in the past and it was always very good. This time I ordered a stir fry and was absolutely horrible, I couldn't even eat it. The noodles were so over done that they were mushy and clumped together. There was also way too much sauce and very few vegetables. It was very disappointing to say the least."
Justice-Keith Monroe, a year ago, 1, 'Pre-Pandemic... spending $16 for a salad was okay, when it‚Äôs worth it. However, Post -Pandemic, i returned after the gym to get a salad, and the girl prepping the salad didn‚Äôt even toss it. Just put it in a bowl. The results, a huge clump of chicken breasts that tastes as if it was bad. The service isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs used to be, but I‚Äôll blame it on the Corona blues that we all have. I can eat around the big clump of chicken breast, and enjoy the salad. I can almost excuse the poor service.

Jui Pendharkar, a year ago, 3, 'Overall the taste was good. But the reason for giving 3 stars is my dishes had a LOT of noodles and very few pieces of veggies, tofu, chicken.

Ratio of noodles vs other ingredients was opposite to what they display in their pictures. Very disappointing.'

Gregory Jacobs, a year ago, 1, 'We‚Äôve been ordering delivery from Honeygrow for a quite bit now, but unfortunately just about every other order we don‚Äôt get any dressing for the salad or sauce for the stir fry bowl, even though we pay extra for it to be on the side.\n\nWe‚Äôve managed to scrounge up things in the past to put on the salad/bowls when this has happened (olive oil, soy sauce, etc.), but this time we‚Äôre out of those things.\n\nReceiving a dry salad is incredibly disappointing.

There are tons of spicy sauces and the high tech screens allow you to customize to your heart's delight. Although it creepily asks for your phone number each time you place an order (I mean these days, who doesn't know your phone number) the process is seamless.\n\nI love the seasoned turkey bowl with extra spicy miso.\n\nOnly complaint - wait times sometimes can be ~10 minutes, but at least it gives you some downtime to reflect on your life and whether Hoboken is the Manhattan of New Jersey or whether Manhattan is the Hoboken of New York. Either way, you're still boarding a crowded train."

Rachel Bien, 2 years ago, 2, 'Our experience at the Hoboken Honeygrow gets more and more frustrating. Although the food is good the experience is awful and inconsistent. When we first starting going to honeygrow about a year ago they were efficient, accurate, kind and fast. Now they are sloppy, rude and slow. They consistent forget something from our order and use the wrong ingredients that we selected for our create your own meals. Today we orders on the mobile app for pick up and after my boyfriend walked back home with our meals, the lettuce cup that is the base of my entire meal was missing. He proceeded to walk back to the restaurant to be greeted with NO apology and rude judgement when he asked for a bag.

The staff were working as hard as they could, and they were performing well considering the circumstances. But it's clear management or the owners do not respect the time of their customers. It took 41 minutes from the time my order was processed on the electronic kiosk to the time they handed me my take out. The kitchen is not large enough to handle the volume of orders that the restaurant is taking in. I don't even know how to fix this problem other than having some sort of wait time estimate at the kiosk before you order so you know what you're in for. The owners don't care. They get their profit. If I'm going to wait 40 minutes for my food, I'll go somewhere where my time and money are respected. Tough to be those employees for sure."

Zuhal Ta≈ü, 3 years ago, 3, 'The place is clean, the food tastes good and i liked their self order system.

I need to know what i am eating. What if i have an allergy to one of the ingredients? There is only one general warning about peanuts. But what about other food allergies? And one other important thing for me is how many calories the dressing has. No information. The guy at the register said that you can find it on the website. It wasn‚Äôt easy to find but i found the calorie chart for the dressing as i was ready to eat my food waiting in front of me.. The ingredient information isn‚Äôt on the same page, so it took 5 minutes to find the ingredients too.. i hated that they don‚Äôt have the list for the dressings at the restaurant.'

Melanie Tam, 3 years ago, 4, "Since moving to Hoboken, I had been wanting to try Honeygrow. I hadn't yet because it was a bit of a walk from where a live. Fast forward to one Sunday, when my BF and I were walking around trying to decide what to eat for lunch. We wanted something relatively healthy, and that's when he pointed out HoneyGrow.\n\nOnce you walk in, it's a self-ordering system. They have a few stations where you can pick what you want and customize it to exactly how you like it. I went with the summer seasonal item, the Chesapeake Crab (noodles (+50 cents for wheat), with tomatoes, red onion, scallion, parsley, and swapped the bell pepper for bean sprouts). It was served in this tomato brothy sauce, which was packed with flavor. They also gave a generous helping of crab, which I did not expect. I enjoyed every bite, especially with some Sriracha sauce. BF got the Sweet Soy Five Spice (brown rice, spiced ground turkey, green beans, red onions, sesame seeds). He liked his too but his portion looked small - smaller than mine at least.\n\nMy favorite thing about Honeygrow is that the menu items are customizable. If there's a menu item you like but an ingredient in there that you don't, you can easily swap it out. If that's still not your thing, you can always create your own stir fry. Be prepared to wait though. We waited about 15 minutes before our food was finally ready. But it was worth the wait."
Steven Hoffenson, 3 years ago, 3, 'Great spot for fresh, healthy (depending on what you order) food that tastes good. Lately, it has been taking a VERY long time to get served.

I said to myself what is my important  my craving for this place or my health.  Here is what happened today. I arrived tonight, ordered my usual and saw that the entire staff was cleaning already and it was only 8:30pm.  They were cross contaminating everything, cleaning with up with vacuums, sweeping up dirty floor water with broom while throwing speckles of that dirty water into the food prep station which contains all the vegetables, meats, and toppings, etc.  They need to hire a new crew with a more competent manager.  I witness this place from being one of my go to places to eat but I saw it slowly becoming more and more a place I wouldn't even recommend anymore.  The owners need to be more aware of the locations and pay more attention to the condition, everything is falling apart from the gate door, floor, and bathroom smells disgusting.  Even the prep station is always a mess with food everywhere in all corners where i witness an employee just knock the food back into random trays which will explain once when i got a piece of chicken in my tofu dish, made me really upset since I am a vegan.  My advice to owners is that you guys need to have a new manager to over look the crews, and also for the owners to have weekly visits and to see for themselves if they would be proud of what this place is becoming."
