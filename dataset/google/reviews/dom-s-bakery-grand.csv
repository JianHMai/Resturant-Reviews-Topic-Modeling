Dom, 11 months ago, 1, 'Every year I order over a $100 worth of bread for Christmas Eve, sometimes up to $200. This year it was a small order, due to the pandemic of under a $100. The lady mixed up my order date for thanksgiving instead of Christmas Eve. She left a voicemail, I got back to her, and clarified I only order bread once a year for Christmas Eve, she proceeded to yell at me saying they would never take an order this far in advance for Christmas Eve. My first question every year I call is , ‚Äúcan I place an order for Christmas Eve‚Äù and then we continue from there. It is a very simple mistake to confuse holiday dates , whether it was the employee or customer, what is not acceptable is calling customers up and then arguing with them, and then saying you have to pay in full up front if you still plan to get bread on Christmas Eve , as if I‚Äôm some criminal that places bread orders and doesn‚Äôt show lol. Great bread , terrible service , My family and I will not be coming back here.'

Luca De Simone, a year ago, 5, 'this is by far the best Italian Bakery in Hoboken.\nTry the white bread Panella (Pagnotta) and the sausage bread.\nThey also make plain italian style pizza (bread, tomatoes and oregano. NO cheese).\nThe owner is from a town south of Naples and knows his stuff!'

Chef Giusepp, a year ago, 4, "The best bakery in Hoboken. OLD SCHOOL!!! Hopefully you're lucky enough to get Dom to take you in the back to see the 120 year old oven. They make great bread and meat bread. BUT!! The Sfogliatell is to die for. Get there early before it's sold out!!!"
Ron Esposito, a year ago, 5, 'Best bread and tomato pies!'
adam decicco, a year ago, 5, 'Can\'t say enough about the quality of the bread from Dom\'s. I\'ve been eating their bread since 1985. In addition, you can tell when you go out to a restaurant in town, whether they use Dom\'s bread. Truly a staple of quality. I serve this bread with the lunch program in Union City and the kids all rave over it. Even my Shih Tzu Abby would choose Dom\'s bread over all others for 17 years. We\'ve done the "Pepsi challenge" over many years and she takes Dom\'s every time.'
Laura Olivieri, a year ago, 5, "The smell of the fresh baked bread is something I still dream of. Big part of my childhood and it is to die for. Nothing like it anywhere else. Thank you Dom's!!!"
Rae Shock, a year ago, 4, 'Not much at this place, but the Bread and focaccia where great!'
Khalid Shaikh, a year ago, 5, 'Top notch tomato pizza bread which I am unsure is mistaken for Focaccia.  It is not formal Focaccia.  He also sells baguettes and Focaccia.  Excellent pizza bread.  Cannot get it anywhere else in the country.'

Dennis W., 2 years ago, 5, "Old school bakery, supposedly a favorite of old blue eyes himself, Frank Sinatra, who grew up in Hoboken.  Not sure if the old guy who's always working at the counter on weekends is Dom (or maybe Dom's son?), but he's always friendly and gets your order fast.  He may look a little grumpy, but that adds to the old school character of this place.  Most importantly, the quality of the bread is perfectly delicious.  Don't let the decor dissuade you.... Definitely a Hoboken institution."

Leonard Pollara, 2 years ago, 5, "From the skilled hands of a rare person in today's world,  a master baker, comes the best sfogliatelle I have eaten in the world.  I travel for work and make it a point to 'follow my nose' to discover local bakeries.  Fresh bread and coffee is often my breakfast of choice. Dom's Sfogliatelle is the best by far of any other I have had anywhere else in the US, Europe, and anywhere else one might find an authentic Italian style bakery.\nOrder the night before!"

Myles Helfand, 3 years ago, 4, "They bake fresh daily, so the earlier you show up, the bigger the selection you'll have to choose from -- including, if you're lucky, the best traditional Italian sfogliatelle you'll probably ever eat. (Almost all the stuff they bake is savory, but man, the lobster tails are one heck of an exception.)"

Lynn Fortney, 6 years ago, 5, "I am so glad I walked far, far away from The Tourist bakery (which is fine for what it is) to the treasure that is Dom's.  One square of Dom's tomato pie/focaccia, a beautiful sfogliatelle of layers and layers of leafy pastry embracing a perfect filling of lemony ricotta, and an enjoyable conversation with Esther behind the counter is a lunch experience I may never replicate. I regret not being able to try one of Dom's breads.  So much good food, so little time..."
