DD, 2 months ago, 3, 'Not sure if this is a legit Korean Fried Chicken restaurant. The drumstick and wings both lack flavor. They are good, but lacks a bit of flavor. The sweet spicy flavor also lacks spiciness which is a bummer for people like me who actually enjoy spicy foods in my opinion. I can’t say much about the service because I ordered online for pickup. Upon arriving, my order was ready which was good I guess for a Friday night order. I’ll probably give it another shot next time I’m in the area.'

It is a small place but they deliver and the lunch special is perfect. $10 for portion control rice, cold slaw and wings...soy garlic or spicy or half/half. Delicious 😋 never disappoints.

Adriel ', 8 months ago, 2, "The serving size is fairly large but I have a few big issues with this place. The menu is limited to like 5 different things, prices jump from lunchtime to dinnertime and the chicken wrap that I ordered had no real flavor whatsoever, it's as if they didn't season the chicken before they cooked it. The fries however, were really crispy and the sauce you get with every order makes the food tolerable."

Located on Washington St in the heart of Hoboken's main thoroughfare, this place does a decent version of the sweet, fried, chicken wings and drumsticks.   They have other Korean specialties... But we've never seen an Asian working here, so don't expect authentic tastes.  Prices are decent... While the service is bland."

Ry D’Lessio, 2 years ago, 4, 'If you\'re too lazy to take the path for AUTHENTIC Korean Fried Chicken in NYC, this PLACE IS THE CLOSEST spot for your famous Soy Garlic wings. Although, I\'ve had better quality as far as flavoring and batter. The only downfall about this restaurant is the wait time. Normally, "KFC" will take about 35-40 minutes (even less) to make at other korean restaurant . Whoever is cooking in the back makes the wait a little longer. I once waited over an HOUR for a small batch of fried wings and THIS WAS NOT A DELIVERY OPTION. Be prepare for the wait time. Don\'t be surprised if you wait longer than 45 minutes but it\'s worth the wait once you feast! If you can\'t wait that long, CALL AHEAD! I honestly forgot to call ahead since I thought it wouldn\'t be that bad of waiting around. Learned the hard way.\n\n** if you like your wings extra crispy, don\'t be afraid to say so. The lady who owns this restaurant is extremely nice! She listens to every feedback! **'

David Wilson, 2 years ago, 5, 'I spent the last five months in SE Asia where I became obsessed with Korean fried chicken, so I’m really happy Hoboken — not known for having very interesting restaurants in general — has this place. The food isn’t earth-shattering but it’s exactly as it should be for a cheap-and-cheerful chicken place.\n\nHad the spicy fried and it was delicious. Will definitely be ordering whenever I get a craving for Korean fried chicken.\n\n👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻'
Katie, 2 years ago, 5, "Really tasty Korean fried chicken - both the regular and spicy are great, though the other stuff on the menu leaves a bit to be desired.\n\nBe warned that the spicy sauce - while not excruciatingly spicy - is sticky and will burn the skin around your mouth if you don't eat neatly."

Domenick Amato, 5 years ago, 1, "This place has good food - not great, but good.  Where it fails dramatically is in customer service.  My first time was in person and the woman behind the counter was pretty much annoyed that I had questions.  She was dismissive and seemed more interested in watching her baby sleep in the cradle behind the register than serving me.  It was early afternoon - I was the only person there.  I went for a twenty minute walk only to come back and find my order was only half prepared.  I figured it was a glitch but then she literally threw my food at me like she could not be bothered.   I figured I'd try again another time so I ordered in.  The guy on the phone was polite and, while slow, my order was perfect.  Tonight we ordered via GrubHub.  The notifications showed that our food was on its way.  A half hour after it was supposed to have arrived - nothing.  We called the place directly and the dreaded lady was there.  I pressed her and she blamed it all on GH but I wasn't buying it.  She finally caved and admitted our order had not been processed or cooked yet!  One hour and forty minutes later and not even processed!?!?  Rather than apologize and offer to make good she got rather defensive on the phone and slammed it down on me.  I call Grubhub and they were appalled and stated the restaurant had been negligent in it's notifications.  I had people over on a Saturday night so I had no choice but to wait rather than cancel.  GrubHub called her and I don't know what they did but we got a call from her 2 minutes later profusely apologizing and she told us our food would arrive within 15 minutes.  It did.  Grubhub followed up and offered me a deep discount on our order.  I am in no way being sexist but that woman is a horror and really brings the place down.  She needs to either step up or step out.  Again, the food is fine but not spectacular enough to warrant the inconsistent and rude service you get.  They must rely a lot on Stevens students because with ordinary clientele they are tone deaf - well, at least she is.  I will never order from there again."

Ian, 5 years ago, 4, "Some of the best chicken I've ever had, it's not very heavily breaded and very crisp. The two flavors they offer are both great and you can't go wrong with either of them.

I tried to order delivery and was told I was too far, by one block and they were too busy to bring the food.\n\nOther restaurants don\'t have these problems. Chicken Factory needs to figure out how to serve customers better. When I want food from them I\'m beginning think the answer will likely be "no."'
Peter Kim, 8 years ago, 2, "As a Korean American who lives in Hoboken, I'm torn about giving this place a poor review because this is the only Korean-ish restaurant in Hoboken and I wish there were more.\n\nBut as much as I tried to like them, I just didn't enjoy my experience there. The chicken was okay. We got a mixed drumstick/wing plate. I think the wings are better because the proportion of batter to meat is probably higher and you get more of the tasty flavoring. The chicken was pretty good but it not as good as Kyochon.\n\nAt first, I thought the chicken was overpriced but when I got through my meal, I was pretty full so it's deceptively filling.\n\nThe bibimbap was pretty bad compared to ones you'll find in Koreantown. I would not recommend it unless you really can't eat anything else.\n\nI thought the eating experience at the restaurant was pretty poor. They should give people hand wipes since it is chicken. Also, even though it wasn't an extremely hot day, it was still fairly warm and they didn't seem inclined to turn the A/C on, which made me think they were really cheap and stingy.\n\nI think I'm going to avoid this place and just drive up to Fort Lee or go to Manhattan for Korean food."
