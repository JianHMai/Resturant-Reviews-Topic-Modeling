Monish Datta, a day ago, 4, 'Okay so I didn’t get any photos of my food here because it wasn’t very inspiring. Think deli level quality of pancakes, egg white omelet, side of bacon etc. standard deli fare and thankfully at not much higher than NYC deli prices. Bit of a hike to get to if you’re a Manhattan person but good spot with beautiful interiors and tasteful decor for the off chance you find yourself in Hoboken, NJ.'

And salmon was also not very fresh. Bad bad experience. I am that basic person who takes photos of my food everyday (even at home) but this was so bad that I was embarrassed To take the picture and post it on my Instagram.'

The service was amazing, from the wait staff, bussers, etc. The ambiance was so nice with the lights and area for outdoor dining. Food and drinks were great! I had the mussels and pommes frites and a couple of Papi’s margaritas. Everything was awesome!'
Licia McClary, a month ago, 5, 'stopped in yesterday at 5:00 and was welcomed by patrons who immediately moved over a seat at the bar so we could sit at the bar too!  Always nice way to start out when you come across kind people.  The vibe was perfect for us, friendly people having cocktails and food at the bar.  The bartender Alex was very helpful making suggestions off the menu and offered a taste of his favorite Rose so I could decide what I wanted.  His pick was spot on and so was his food suggestions.  I had the avocado and artichoke salad which is baby arugula, creamy warm and lemon dressing with avocados and artichokes.  Alex suggested adding grilled salmon on top.  Just delicious together.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and made my salad a meal.  Rich had fish and chips with malt vinegar and thin frittes!  He said it was really good.  To top it all off we had the warm double chocolate sundae which is chocolate bread pudding, vanilla gelato and home made whipped cream...WOW... in a word.  The chocolate bread pudding had the consistency of a brownie but not the sugar overload.  Just decadent and delicious.  We both enjoyed the meal, the people and the service was just fabulous, thanks Alex.  We will be back... Just to add this, we went back this Sunday and this time Josh and Rachel took care of us and they were fantastic.  Tried different dishes and loved them as well.  Had the calamari salad which was very different than the usual calamari with red sauce.  I Loved it!  It was fried and added on top of baby arugula, nicoise olives, chopped tomatoes, grated parmesan, fresh lemon...just delicious! Also had the homemade gnocchi with Bolognese to die for.  Rich had the steak, a side of broccoli rabe and mashed potatoes versus fries and everything was just terrific.  This is a very welcoming bar with a different menu which is just such a welcome change.  Love it here!'

Noa L, a month ago, 1, 'Food was mediocre at best. Calling their restaurant and dishes with a French name does not mean that’s how the French do it, and I’m from France. It was summer, we were walking by in the afternoon, and decided to stop by and eat. First thing, the host said “I can give you this table if you can eat in less than an hour”, so that’s nice. We said yes, we sat, server was ok, not nice, but not nasty either. After we ordered, I went inside to use the restroom, and as I left the restaurant to go back to our table outside, I hear the manager say to the host “no more sandal people”. Needless to say my outfit was worth more than his monthly salary and he was wearing Walmart clothes (not that there’s anything wrong with that, just putting it into context). I almost responded something, then I decided “that’s what yelp is for”.'

A perfect example of this was the fish & chips that I had there 2 weeks ago. The fish was perfectly cooked but it had no flavor. The tartar sauce was bland. The fries, which are usually excellent, were undercooked and not seasoned. The lobster roll was underwhelming in the amount of lobster and taste. The burger was very good. So, go and enjoy Hoboken... and you may love the food or you may say, "meh".'

P Pouls, 3 months ago, 1, 'This was our third time at Elysian Cafe. Quite a disappointing experience as a result of manager Chris’ unprofessional and I’ll-mannered behavior. We wanted to get some clarification regarding the parking validation at Little Man’s Parking Structure, where they tell you parking is free with validation from Elysian but at the Cafe they actually charge you. Chris simply rolled his eyes and walked away, yes he turn his back and walked away, in the middle of our exchange. We were sincerely confused as to what might have caused the attitude and reaction - still unclear. In summary, our customer experience was down-hill after that. Chris clearly handle the simple exchange in a very poor manner. Sad that that his actions reflects poorly on the legacy, and hard work of founders, of the Elysian Cafe. Not a good approach, Chris. His mediocre example then follows down the line to those employees under his.'

Dhatrish Rajdev, 3 months ago, 3, "It's a place where you go (because outside seating is beautiful) before you go to a fabled restaurant for sumptuous and delectable meal.\n\nFood was bland and neither breakfast nor dinner offered satiation of having eaten soulful food."
Patricia Cellini, 3 months ago, 2, 'This restaurant was a suggestion from my grandson who goes to college in the area. The restaurant was busy outside but we chose to sit inside. Even though it was a Saturday afternoon, the only available menu was the “brunch” menu which had more egg dishes than anything else on it. We were greeted by our server and asked for water which took close to 5 minutes to receive. My grandson ordered steak and eggs with “Lyonnaise” potatoes otherwise known as home fries and I ordered poached eggs Florentine which was similar to eggs Benedict but with spinach and Hollandaise rather than ham. I also ordered the lyonnaise potatoes. I’m not sure if his food was cool when it was served but mine certainly was and I received French fries which had to be sent back for the correct potatoes.\nThe “best” part of this experience was when the smoke alarms went off in full blazes and couldn’t be shut off until the fire department arrived!\nNo type of compensation was offered for the inconvenience which made the temperature of the food even more unforgivable.'

The food was pretty yum, we tried the avocado toast, steak and eggies, bacon, french toast, and the egg white omelet. The french toast was the best. We needed some more salt and pepper on the rest. For 5 plates, coffee and 3 drinks, it was just over a hundo. Not bad. I don't think I'd come back but if you want a decent breakfast  with good service, try it out!"

Outside seating during nice weather is so pleasant and reminds me of European cafes. The food is delicious classic brasserie fare, delivered by well seasoned staff. Cocktails are excellent, they have a nice selection of beers on tap, and a short but sweet wine list. Nothing is too fussy or expensive. Two for one night is a gem!"
