Eduard, a day ago, 5, 'Very nice ambience and high quality food, very nice staff too - seldom luxury these days. Tried smoked Amish chicken and assorted smoked seafood served with toasts - delicious, followed by heavenly cheesecake. Top notch quality of ingredients, very pleased with that. I would suggest placing guests at a greater distance from each other though, packing one area tightly while 75% of tables are vacant is concerning, and by the looks of it it was not a 6 ft. distance. May be they were expecting more guests at other tables, but we were there for a good hour and a half, noticed not much influx... Aside from that very solid performance, 5 stars, would highly recommend.'

Waited another 10min for him to make a martini that costs $16+tax. The martini is not even served in a classic tall martini glass..The guys sat next to me, they also waited quite long just to give an order. The barmen told everyone that he is sorry for the wait. If you are 5 star hotel, the service should be similar. When not, you lose customers.'

followJTusa JT USA, 2 months ago, 4, "This is our favorite place to celebrate special occasions, and also to just enjoy an atmosphere where well-prepared food and service is of prime importance. Out-of-town visitors get a treat of the Manhattan skyline at night. I relish the appetizer plate of Smoked fish and mussels.The Country Terrine and the Duck Liver Pâté are just as delectable. My husband and I prefer weekdays (we like a calm atmosphere).There is excitement in the air on Week-ends when the prix fixe all-you-can-eat food arrive served on small plates. The menu online doesn’t always reflect new features, such as two different aged steaks offered recently.The Steelhead Trout was a surprise pleasure. Vegetables and sides served with the main courses are meticulously prepared. At a recent lunch, we started with a the #Clam Chowder garnished with smoked ham. It was rich and satisfying. I've tried the smoked Chicken sometime ago but I'd take it easy on the salt. Burgers as well as #Oysters are also served. Desserts are worthy of the hotel status so, leave room for dessert. There used to be a choice of East Coast or West Coast oysters but please check. I always ask that the brioche for my sliders do not get  the least charred. (They listen.)There will be no regrets for ordering bread here, so well worth the calories :-) My old favorite was the Salt Cod and Shrimp appetizer but I am convinced that the recipe has been tweaked since those summers when we enjoyed Happy Hour at the bar. For us, the best waiter is Roosevelt. The man of the hour at the bar, is Angel, so aptly named.) GM Mr. Wendy Weng took over the helm from our friend Carlos who has moved to warmer climes.

I think it's a great place for special occasions.\n\nThe view of Manhattan is spectacular as they are so close to the water. Hoboken is typically a great town for bars and food and this one doesn't disappoint. Afterwards, take a walk along the Hudson if the weather is right."

Starting from a gazpacho, parfait and fruit bowl, French toast, going into arugula salad with Israeli cous cous and cranberries which helps to take a break from starchy and more dense foods such as pasta “orecchiette” , meatballs , eggs.. also during brunch you can ask for a second round of a specific food. In addition to all that mimosas are bottomless and all the staff is very welcoming.'

We were bussing our own tables. My husband & I were sitting at our own table & didn’t get HALF of the items. They just stopped serving us, yeah, the people paying nearly $5k for a baptism. They did the same to my guests who spoke up about it. My guests also left before the party was over, that’s how slow the service was. Tables weren’t set up correctly. Event manager wasn’t there day of event & didn’t even bother to tell me ahead of time. Cake was  brought out after asking a dozen times. Totally understaffed. I could go on & on. I even reached out after I slept on it for a few days because I was still disappointed. I was told “I’ll speak to the GM” & a week later no response still.

Order the Hoboken IPA for $10. Was not cold and was not even a pint. Ordered the lobster role for $31, what a joke in terms of quantity and taste. Ordered it on a bed of salad and it came on one leave of salad. Also ordered the Halifax burger for $16 medium cooked. It was yummy except for the center being rare. Waitress was not too attentive at all. Mind this was on a Wednesday afternoon with few patrons. Will never go back and would not recommend. Prices do not reflect what you get.

Couldn’t put our two tables together to celebrate a small birthday dinner.  Food items were cheap in quality, but had the nerve to charge 5.00 for bread for the table. But, glad we asked for the bread it was the only item that tasted good. Last but not least, the table and chairs were cheap. Felt like I was at a diner. Looking at people eating outside was apparently,  the great ambiance and the couple of accent walls they had in the restaurant.

The main issue I had was she made it clear we had a two hour unlimited brunch limit and we had to chase her down a few times to get mimosa refills while she seemed to have been paying more attention to other tables. For the unlimited brunch it was small bites and mimosas or bloody marys for $45 each which was a good deal. Some of the bites such as the wings and french toast were good but others like the poached eggs and pasta were not. The bill came to about $98 and all in all we had and ok time.'

The food was o.k. there was few restaurants across the street that wasn't luxury and my bill would have been half the price. My waiter was the worst part he didn't tell us the specials and was completely rude. We saw people get a lobster after us and lied to the manager that is was sold out by the time we sat down. He did not let us know about the specials and from the beginning his presence  was dismal. If I'm going to pay $44 bucks for just and okay steak at least let customer service be ok. Just aweful. I also did book it for the view, I'm not sure if windows are supposed to be dirty but i wasn't able to enjoy it as much..."

Try their lamb meat balls and scallops. The portion sizes for entrees is medium size as per price of the dish. Their cocktails were okay. Ordered the strawberry Negroni which came with strawberry infused ice cube. Overall a decent experience. The food is delicious but pricy.'
Steven Zhang, a year ago, 1, "[Bad experience]\nI understand that it's a tough time for many restaurants because of the coronavirus. This place only provides a fixed brunch menu for now, and I thought it's a good idea because it can save time and make the cooking process simpler and more efficient, but in fact, it didn't work in this place.\nMy wife and I arrived there around 11:20 am and sat in cold wind (below 60F) for more than 45 min before we got the first round 2 - 3 small dishes around 12:10 noon. We complained to the manager directly, then some other dishes (around 6 or 7) were soonly delivered to our table in 2 minutes. Obviously, these food had already been completed in the kitchen but was delayed due to its slow operation. We sat in the wind for another 30 minutes and got the last two dishes (beef slider and cheese croissant) which are cold. We believed these dishes had also stayed in the kitchen for a long time. We noticed that there were at least 2 to 3 tables of clients had also complained to waiters or the manager for the same reason while we were there. We didn't finish these meals at last because we started to feel not well. We paid the check and backed home, and spent the whole afternoon and night at home with the heater and hot coffee. We got cold."

If you make a reservation, confirm your party will sit together.\n\nI made a reservation with Halifax for 14 people two weeks in advance.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant and our hostess showed us to where we\'d be sitting, she said, "These are your two tables."\n\nI said, "Excuse me? We won\'t be sitting together?"\n\nThe hostess told me that despite making a reservation two weeks in advance, there were two groups who made a reservation a month in advance so they\'d have priority to the long tables.\n\nThat\'s fine - but wouldn\'t you think to mention that on the phone?\n\nI had 14 people now staring me, standing around awkwardly trying to hide their disappointment that we wouldn\'t all be sitting together.\n\n"Can we just push these two tables together?" I asked. "No, they won\'t fit." (There was plenty of room.)\n\nThe hostess just kept saying there was nothing she could do.\n\nIt was a really disheartening experience from a place I otherwise used to love. I felt like they were trying to pull one over on me by not mentioning we wouldn\'t all be seated together. I mean, why would I call and make a reservation for 14 people if I didn\'t expect to sit together?\n\nFood wise it was all delicious except the soup. Everyone agreed it tasted like burnt cigarettes.

When the assistant general manager finally got back to me a few days after my requests, she emailed me. I immediately called her back with questions and she didn\'t seem thrilled I had called so I asked what the best way to contact her was. She said email so that nothing got lost as she "answers them in the order they are received" and she was often walking the floors and wouldn\'t want to miss a call. I emailed back and forth my questions (each time took a day to respond back to). I tried calling after that, but no one would answer. Finally, I told her we were interested in Booking the venue for the day and time she had said was available and to please let me know next steps. No response. This was a Friday. Instead Monday morning I get an email reply back answering another question in my email, but not addressing the fact that I had asked how I could reserve the date. I decided to go in person. After finally meeting with her, and her showing me the space she asks for the date again, and then proceeds to tell me she just sent a contract to someone on Saturday! I said I emailed her Friday asking to reserve the date, and her response back was she gets a lot of emails. Well then maybe email shouldn\'t be your preferred method. This was extremely frustrating as we had told her we were very interested before the final email. A simple courtesy of "someone else is looking at this date" etc would have been professional. Instead of an apology she told me that her original email states nothing is reserved until the contract is signed. NO kidding. I felt that the whole interaction was unprofessional. After that I contacted the general manager, and asked for him to speak with me so I could provide feedback about the process. I still have yet to receive a call or email back. So, after all that maybe I was done a favor because obviously they are not organized or easy to work with.'

Felicia McEnroe, 2 years ago, 2, 'Planned a bridal shower at Halifax and the operation leaves much to be desired. The Assistant General Manager, who coordinated most of the planning before the day was great! However, the day of operation was somewhat embarrassing to be associated with the W Hotel.\n\nWhen the bridesmaids and my family arrived early to set up for the shower they were advised by the hostess (or who ever was standing at the podium) that there was no bridal shower being hosted that day. This caused so much unneeded confusion and panic. Not sure who finally clarified - but how disorganized can you be. As a hostess or whoever is greeting customers it\'s pretty simple to provide that person with a run of show for the day. I understand there is a switch over with parties but as a venue that throws events consistently, this is basic. Also customer service 101 .... a simple "let me look into that for you".\n\nThe chef came out of the kitchen to ask about allergies at the party. What a joke ... the ENTIRE menu is allergens that can not be accommodated (nuts, dairy, gluten). Please keep in mind I already discussed these allergens with the coordinator so they should have already been aware, and was told that no adjustments can be made. And if he was double checking ... great. But it just seems foolish for a chef to come out and ask about allergens just to respond, "we can not accommodate". Its 2019 ... Halifax is so behind on the fact that MANY restaurants are making accommodations for life threatening food allergies.\n\nYou are able to pick 10 items from the menu, my table never saw a couple of the food options. Also, keep in mind, food does not continuously come out, it\'s family style and only 2 plates of food per table were served. Myself and many others left the brunch still hungry. Only plus ... champagne was flowing constantly.\n\nThe kitchen started serving food late, almost 30 min into the party. 1 min before the party was over (2 hour party) they were already kicking us out. Extremely rude considering we accommodated the restaurant\'s late start and horrible customer service.\n\nI would never have another party at this venue, especially considering the prices they charge. If you\'re going to be expecting people to pay for best in class service, you should probably master the basics.'
Ally Hirschlag, 2 years ago, 2, 'I\'m giving Halifax two stars because the view and style of the restaurant is lovely and the food was genuinely delicious. However, much of the experience eating there was tainted by some of the worst service I\'ve ever experienced. First, we were told we couldn\'t sit at a table because they had reservations coming in. We were there for 90 minutes, and about half the tables in the restaurant remained empty. Sitting at the bar was fine, except the server could not have been less hospitable. Halifax has a pre-fix option where you get the entire tasting menu plus drinks for $35 per person. It\'s a lengthy menu, so my mother and I were hesitant to commit to that, but our server said that was the only option for brunch, which is simply not true. Upon closer inspection of the menu, we saw that we could do the menu a la cart if we wanted to. The server was obviously trying to upsell us by not being forthcoming about that option. She also said the menu\'s options were small enough that it wouldn\'t be overwhelming. Well, we saw what the full tasting menu looked like because the couple next to us got it, and let me tell you, unless you\'re used to eating two to three meals in one sitting, that\'s WAY too much food. Once we noted that we\'d like to do the menu a la cart, our server couldn\'t be bothered with us. She never checked in to see how our food was, we had to hail her down for waters which took 10 minutes to come. The last straw was when we asked to get what remained of our food (note: we got less than half of the menu between the two of us, and we still had food left over), and she told us they "don\'t wrap up leftover food for people who do a la cart." What the heck kind of crazy rule is that?? That policy is absolutely absurd and extremely wasteful because they\'re just going to throw that food away. Halifax managers, if you\'re listening, this policy is shameful, especially in this day and age where so much of the world is struggling with food insecurity (unless of course you send leftovers to a nearby homeless shelter which I doubt you do). Finally, we had to essentially yell across the bar to get our check, which was incorrect (we\'d ordered two dishes that never came, but she left those on the check since she obviously had no idea whether they came or not since she never checked in). If we ever return to Halifax, it\'ll be for table service which, hopefully, is any level above the abysmal service at the bar.'

Paolo our service attendant was phenomenal ! They definitely wanted us to have a great time and we sure did! The manager Maria was very sweet and understanding! Highly recommend this place. The view of NYC skyline is right across the restaurant which is a plus!'

So lets get into the review of the small dishes.\n\nThe Challah French toast was one of the highlights of the meal. It was soft, delicious, and not too sweet.\n\nThe Strawberry Arugula salad left something to be desired. I found it dry and bland.\n\nThe egg and hash had a nice texture and flavor. I love that it was served in cute little metal pan.\n\nThe Spring pea purée tasted very earthy, shall we say grass-like?\n\nThe salmon tasted very delicious and fresh.\n\nThe Deviled eggs were light and fluffy.\n\nThe Mac and cheese had nice cheesy flavor with multiple cheeses covering the cup-shaped shells.\n\nThe Poutine was unique take on the Canadian classic with potatoes instead of fries. This was another favorite; absolutely delicious.\n\nThe Chicken wings were a bit too salty .\n\nThe Gazpacho has good flavors packed into a small little cup.\n\nThe Fried rice had a great aroma when I opened up the cute little box it was packed in. Unfortunately, the taste didn’t live up to delicious smell; it was kind of plain and shrimp tasted like it was frozen.\n\nThe Reuben was another one of my faves so delicious - even though I was stuffed when it came I couldn’t resist eating it.\n\nFinally, the Meatball sandwich was juicy and flavorful.\n\nI definitely will be returning to try out other foods this restaurant offers!'

The ham on the eggs benedict lacked any flavor and the hollandaise was barely noticeable. They appearently have the brunch reserved weeks in advance but I didn't see anything on that menu that called to me."

Jonathan Otto, 2 years ago, 1, 'Sit at the bar only. They know what they’re doing. The service is garbage anywhere else. Over an hour waiting to be served the wrong order (entrees) and no appetizers ever came out. Quick update: the manage offered to remove the apps we didn’t receive from the bill. Is this a joke? Thanks for not charging us the items we ordered but you didn’t give us.'

And once you're seated, you get a great view of the Hudson River and NYC skyline.\n\nAre here for a late lunch wth a friend. We both got the Halifax Burger - very delicious and decadent. I especially liked the bacon-onion marmalade and Fresno pepper sauce. However, both burgers were extremely overcooked as me and my friend ordered medium and medium rare respectively and the burger was definitely well done. The salad accompanying the burger was a disappointment - soggy, bitter, and bland.\n\nOverall, will return for the view and another try at the menu. We came at an odd time on a weekday so service was slow and could've been better. I hope to return for a better experience."
