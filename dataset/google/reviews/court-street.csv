Jade Briggs, 3 months ago, 4, 'I\'ve had the best lamb in Hoboken and wrote a great review i had the worst lamb in Hoboken and wrote a review. So coming in second best deserves the same. Not only is the lamb portion twice the size of others they actually know what medium rare is. I will admit it wasn\'t full of robust flavor and the rosemary as advertised but it was juicy and had the basic salt and pepper which does meat well when cooked properly.\nafter writing my original review of this place I decided to order using their delivery service. when asked if I wanted to leave a tip for the driver I told them I would be tipping in cash. The driver text me and said five minutes away I replied "ok apt 1" my bell rings twice and when I go to the door my food was left on the door knob of the entry way door on the first level of the building. Then he came back and managed to climb those steps to double check if I paid. I\'ll be picking up my food from here on out.'

Katherine Kaplan, 3 months ago, 3, 'Food is great, but they will not deliver outside of Hoboken, otherwise I would order from them once a week. When asked, they say its because they will only keep one delivery person on staff and do not want to send him outside of Hoboken.'
Two Spoons, 3 months ago, 3, 'Overall - Food was good ... service was not\n\nFood - Ordered entrees from the daily menu and appetizer from the regular menu.  All items were fresh and had a good diversity in flavors .\n\nService - Took time to make reservation, but that did not help.  Arrived and both wait staff and bar staff made eye contact and then proceeded to ignore us.  Finally figured out where the hostess stand was and after waiting to get help eventually we were seated.  Waited, waited, waited and finally bus staff member took initiative to take our order.  Waitress spent the rest of our time there barely checking on us and taking unnecessarily long time to do anything.  Again, bus staff made sure water was refilled, etc.\n\nAtmosphere - Sat outside (with reservation) ended up in section that is artificial turf  under canopies.  Bit tricky to move chairs and get situated at table but overall reasonable COVID style setup.\n\nPrice - Food was a good value, but service level made things feel like it was too costly.'

We will absolutely be going back. This was our first time dining inside in almost a year and we felt safe the entire time. The staff were all compliant with masks and there was hand sanitizer everywhere. All the tables were adequately spaced for safe dining. We cannot wait to go back.'

Enjoy your next meal there!"

Nothing else in the area really can compare. It’s clean, it’s reliable and it’s consistent. I have yet to have a bad experience here. I actually find myself only bringing the best of friends to Court Street, like it’s some sort of little secret. I love it and I hope they never change. I hope they are here forever.
