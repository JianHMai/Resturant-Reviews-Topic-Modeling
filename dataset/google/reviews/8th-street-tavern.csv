anthony ucciferri, 2 weeks ago, 1, 'Ok, so when I moved to Hoboken I thought this was going to be my spot. Soon I realized it wasn‚Äôt what I expected‚Ä¶. I got a noise complaint on the first time I brought a person of color with me, where the owner said ‚Äú there are ‚Ä¶'
Meredith Williams, 8 months ago, 4, 'Classic Irish Pub vibes. Come for the drinks stay for the chill atmosphere. We got the Ghost Hawk and Magnify. Bathrooms a bit......'

Lauren -, 3 months ago, 5, "Cool place! Enjoyed the music. Great service at the bar. Just wish it wasn't cash only üòâ"
Shelley Hamilton, 2 months ago, 5, 'Garlic parmesan truffle fries were to die for...really crispy, not soggy.'
Jonathan Pepe, 8 months ago, 4, 'One of the better no frills pubs in town. Has a decent amount of heated outdoor seating. Great tap list and tasty bar food. Epic nachos (come hungry). Super friendly staff. Cash only, so bring ahead and save yourself the ATM fees inside.'
VictoriaNB, 6 months ago, 5, 'Cash only establishment. Both the food and service were excellent and fairly priced. Been there a few times and always had a great experience.'
Lisa Crawford, 10 months ago, 5, "This place was great! Stopped in on a whim. I was hungry and cold lol bartender was wonderful. She answered a bunch of questions for me as I don't live here and didn't know where to go. Manager Anthony (owner maybe? I have no idea) was so ‚Ä¶"
Avishay Cohen, 2 years ago, 4, 'Tasty food. Cold beer. Good place to hang, very generic.'

Dennis Aguilar, 5 months ago, 5, 'Nice bar. Cute girl with the curly hair.'
Riya Antony, 4 years ago, 5, 'They were king enough to get warm water for my friend even though the kitchen was closed when we arrived. I do not like the taste of alcohol in my cocktails and the bar tender made a special blend for me based on what I said I liked and I was so good. Loved it!!'
leah rodgers, 11 months ago, 5, 'Bar food and the feeling at this location is great. Service is always excellent even when they have a full house. The service here is above par.'
marcela ramirez, a year ago, 1, "Services was average the servers had zero attention even when we were just a couple of tables they didn't even tried, I order the Cesar wrap it took about 40 minutes and I got a tiny overpriced wrap, chicken was dry, sweet potato fries ‚Ä¶"
Alexander Kruper, 2 years ago, 5, 'They have good beer, quick draw, good food, quick draw, plenty of TVs and did I mention Quick Draw?!'
Brent Kottner, 4 years ago, 2, "Went here specifically to get growler filled. It was $24 for a 64oz growler I brought in. Didn't feel cold on the upper portion of the growler when poured. Bartender assured me it was full. Got home.... There's no beer for about 4 inches from the opening. I paid a lot, and missed out on a lot of beer."
Dan Paolillo, 9 months ago, 5, 'Friendly staff good food, decent list of local beer'

Angela Miranda, a year ago, 1, 'So, I never really like to waste my time on reviews. But I think this issue needs to be addressed especially during this crazy time we are all living in. My friends and I decided to take a break from quarantine and head to Hoboken for some ‚Ä¶'

Amol Bhatia, 4 years ago, 5, "This place is amazing, great food and service. The Bartender is nice and quick, quality 5/5. Beautiful bar and atmosphere. The Events are one of the best parts of the culture; it's fun, vivacious, ridiculous, and social. It gets pretty crowded and a great place to meet with friends."

Dan F, 3 years ago, 5, "Nice place to go to for a drink. Nothing special about the atmosphere, but there is a darts board and pool table. The bartenders and staff are super friendly and knowledgeable. You wouldn't expect it but they have a very good drink/beer ‚Ä¶"
Dave Curran, 2 years ago, 5, "Best nachos I've had since Brighton Beer Garden (MA) closed.  Great space inside with the giant bar.  Live music some nights.  Will definitely be back"

Alex Harding, 5 years ago, 4, "Pretty good, typical bar food. Decent beer selection. A little pricey, but about average for Hoboken. They have lots of TVs, a jukebox, and some games (pool and buck hunter). My main complaint is that they're cash only (though they supply an ATM and they're pretty up front about being cash only)."
Wireless Zone Lincroft, 2 years ago, 5, 'Moving my son to Hoboken so we stopped in for a quick bite and a beer. Service was excellent at the bar and the Spaten on draft was nice. Chicken nachos were very good! We will be back'
Donna Talavera, a year ago, 5, 'Fun tavern. Good food'
Esteban Gonzalez, 3 years ago, 1, 'Bartender was rude and did not want to serve me some water on a super hot day. Kept insisting that it is a bar and they sell drinks when I had already drank enough and just wanted some water to cool down. Instead I was forced to buy a bottled water down the street.'

Eric Williams, 3 years ago, 4, "Great late night bar in the middle of Hoboken. Far enough uptown from the path frenzy, it makes this place have a local feel. Only downside is the cash only. I was shocked by this and don't see a place thriving without credit cards."
Meracesa Brigers, 2 years ago, 4, "Mouth watering toasty innovative SAMMICHES! ;)\nMy son said he didn't want a sandwich and I ordered up a turkey with swiss on Dutch Crunch and Avacado, the secret sauce and shredded lettuce with fresh veggies ‚Ä¶"
