Sorab Kochhar, a week ago, 5, 'Brass Rail really surprised me. What seemed like a mostly unassuming restaurant bar, really served top notch, quality meals. Even something as simple as wings, the Buffalo chicken lollipops were topped and cooked with some herbs like thyme and really added a floral touch to the dish. The gnocchi was also amazingly indulgent. The last dish was average but the other two were so stellar I have to leave 5 stars.'

Ram Subramanian, 2 months ago, 3, "AUG 2021: Outdoor seating looks fine but the indoor dining upstairs was not a great experience overall. The ambience looks classy at first glance but there was some kind of strange smell perhaps because of lack of air conditioning as we arrived for early dinner around 5.30pm, plus we were constantly poked by a fruit fly throughout the dinner.\n\nThe waitress didn't sound very amicable. We were later greeted by another waiter and he was being super patient and communicative.\n\nOrdered Truffle Buratta Rigatoni and  Salmon. The salmon tasted good but the eggplant in Rigatoni wasn't well-cooked."
Dennis Gilgallon, 2 months ago, 5, "This place was great. The ambience of the railcar upstairs was beautiful. The food was excellent. I'm really looking forward to going back to try the specialty cocktails and brunch.\n\nThe only knock is that the men's bathroom is really really tiny"
Alberto Navarro, 2 months ago, 5, 'This place is fantastic. It used to be my default for weekends brunch when I lived in Hoboken. The menu is constantly changing, and I love that. The cocktail menu is good, but bartenders are the best of Brass Rails. I strongly recommend it for brunch or just drinks.'
Kunal Puranik, 2 months ago, 3, 'We went here on a Thursday. We made reservations just in case. We were greeted bu a nice lady and showed to our tables. The cocktail selection is okay. We went classic and ordered classic mojito and mango margarita. The drinks took a while to come. For starters we ordered house made ricotta, it was the highlight of the night. Its one of the best ricotta I have tried. Being vegetarian we had limited options for entrees. We ordered kale and crispy chickpea salad which was fine and vegan pad thai which was sub par. It was a little to salty and oily. It lacked the pad thai flavours. The second round of drinks took equally long. All in all it was alright but won‚Äôt be visiting again just coz we‚Äôre vegetarians. If you like meat this place is worth a shot'

Had to go sit at the bar instead to even get service, I will say the bartenders are very amicable and attentive compared to the servers. Just based on the servers unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant. It‚Äôs on the expensive side and you‚Äôd expect more.'

I even managed to order a beer without searching online (they use the online menus).\n\nComfortable place. Since being vaccinated and eating indoors again I've found the widely spaced tables are *much* more relaxing than the old way of cramming tables together. I realize eventually they will be allowed to crowd the floor again but until then enjoy the space."

Evan Smith, 7 months ago, 4, 'The food was outstanding! We had the Roasted Veggie ‚ÄúPrimavera‚Äù Flatbread, the Roasted Chicken Breast, and the Seared Salmon, all of which were fantastic and very reasonably priced. However, the margaritas were lacking on the tequila! We had several classic ones, as well as their mango and passionfruit flavors, but felt the same about all of them. Nice atmosphere inside, though, so we‚Äôd definitely come back here again, just for handcrafted cocktails with our food instead!'

Tanya Christian, 7 months ago, 4, "I enjoyed my meal at the Brass Rail. During Covid, dining experiences can be anxiety-inducing, but the wait staff there was properly masked up the entire time and the restaurant did a great job at spacing out patrons. As for the food, it's quite tasty. As a starter we ordered the calamari and it was made to perfection -- not too hard or chewey. Moving on to my entree, I ordered the chicken fettucine and my guest ordered the gnocchi. Both were flavorful and filling (the portions are welcomingly hearty), and they were well timed. I would definitely dine at this restaurant again.\n\nAn added bonus for anybody coming in from other parts of Jersey is that this restaurant is within close walking distance to the Hoboken Train Station, so you can leave your car at home and enjoy a glass of wine or cocktails. We had a strawberry mojito -- a good choice."

He was awesome and the brunch menus was great we had great options and everyone found something they would enjoy. The food portions were great as well. All the staff was friendly wearing masks and gloves. The tables were all distant and very covid friendly. I honestly ended up spending less than I thought I would. We did make a reservation for 12 which was opening and it was definitely had people coming in. It is a place that we would come back to again. I really enjoyed my whole experience.

J A, a year ago, 1, 'Wasn‚Äôt happy about the service and decided against ordering here. Our very first waitress was nice and came to greet us right away. She leaves and disappears and than comes the second waitress. Our second one didn‚Äôt know how to multi task and took forever to come out and take out order (and to be honest they weren‚Äôt busy and had many open tables). Our waitress than tells another waitress to tend to our table. So we wait for the third waitress. Than some white couple come and not only did they seat themselves they get served first but with new third waitress. She takes their order and not only that, serves their drink before they get our order in. So ten minutes in and three waitresses down. Didn‚Äôt take our order and didn‚Äôt acknowledge us like customers. They sat us near the sidewalk where there was heavy traffic- unlike everyone everyone else. Very disappointed with the service and will def not come back here by myself or with my friends.'

Not only is the quality and taste of the food absolutely amazing - to the point where honestly you dont even know what good food is till youve eaten here, but the service is unmatched. I told my server how my girl and i were trying to find a wine tasting but couldn‚Äôt due to weather. She talked to her manager and they ended up making a whole wine tasting menu on the spot- just for us!!!! And they didnt just say ‚Äúheres your first wine, second wine, etc..‚Äù but went all out with extremely in depth descriptions and histories of each wine, along with pairing suggestions and the whole nine. Again, this was not on the menu, they did all this JUST FOR US! Its not like im some rich big wig either im just a normal customer and they made me and my girl feel like royalty. This was a few months ago and i really hope they‚Äôve since added wine tasting to the menu, not only for the very affordable price, but because they‚Äôre absolutely outstanding at it. I only wish i could remember the server and managers name to recognize them individually on an amazing job and night. Thank you!!!!!!'
