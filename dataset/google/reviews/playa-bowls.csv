I've been to many Playa Bowls and have never had any issues. This location is the absolute worst which is sad since its the closest to my house."
anna novash, a year ago, 1, "Im obsessed with Playa bowl especially the Pure Vida but let me tell you the one in Hoboken is the absolute worst one to go to. The one in Belmar is the best then after that would be in Summit. Here in Hoboken they barely put enough granola and the overall taste and experience is awful. The one in Summit you will get a beautiful bowl with a great amount of everything including a thick layer of granola. The fruit is as fresh as can be,  there's no code in the bathroom and the whole customer service experience is great. Im done with you Hoboken Playa. üëã"

Thomas Kielich, a year ago, 4, "Ugh, I'm addicted to this place.\n\nHonestly, the acai bowls (or go with one of the other bases!) and smoothies are the way to go. I think they have some other items on the menu but I can't really speak to it.\n\nBut seriously, this fruit blast is so good. And with toppings like nuts, peanut butter, nutella, and chopped fruit, it leaves you pretty full!\n\nSo, minus one star for the tables being dirty more often than not (and those rounded surfboard tables look cool but are a p.i.t.a. to eat off of) this place is a 5-star option otherwise!"
Z R, a year ago, 2, 'The bowls are delicious. But when you visit the Hoboken location, you need to wait almost a half an hour from when you place your order‚Äî almost every time i‚Äôve visited. The line is always extremely long and the people working are in NO rush to get people their food. Every time i‚Äôm in line, people always leave because of the wait. That‚Äôs business and money that Playa Bowl loses because of the sloth-like pace the employees work at. If any upper management is hopefully reading this, this location really needs to pick up the pace and hire a few more people per shift. Typically, there is one person running the cash register & smoothie machine, one putting toppings on the bowls, and one in the back. All of whom are moving at a glacial pace.  Not enough for the demand. There never appears to be a manager managing anyone behind the counter overseeing employees. On a busy day, the customers become frustrated as 20 of us wait for an a√ßa√≠ bowl. You can see it in everyone‚Äôs faces.\n\nAgain, the bowls are great, but the customer service is god awful.  It‚Äôs a shame because it really hinders the entire experience. By the time I get my bowl, I‚Äôm extremely frustrated.\n\nI‚Äôm currently waiting in the store as I write this, and have been waiting for a half an hour for my bowl, and it just came out wrong. I‚Äôm not even going to say anything because I dont want to wait another half hour, I have things to do today!  My post is now that much more validated. Ugh.'
