Amir Zeenreich, 3 months ago, 2, 'The pastry was good, so was the ice cream I\'ve got (pistachio). Nothing extraordinary, but good\nMy issue is with the value for money. The scoop you get is small and it just feels petty\nI don\'t need a big portion of ice cream but I like it to be my decision to eat less of it\n\nI almost NEVER confront shopkeepers for any injustice felt but I just couldn\'t hold myself this time. The response to my complaint about the small portion size was "it\'s one scoop" and "it\'s gelato"\nInstead of offering me some more (which would have cost them a few more cents), just to make me feel better as a customer, the girl at the front instead decided to educate me and lose my business. I suppose Alessio\'s are not that great at customer service either.'

John, 6 months ago, 3, 'Food is decent but overpriced. Their egg and avocado wrap is a rip off, $8 for a wrap the size of a fist. Service is good. Pizza leaves a lot to be desired.'
Anthony Youssef, 6 months ago, 3, "The place looks great and it's close to the park. However, the prices are a bit high. I might be slightly biased because my latte was more of a cappuccino as it was mostly foam."

Xauen Zirpolo, 7 months ago, 4, "Been here for breakfast, dinner, and coffee! Wide selection of good, quality italian food for dinner; prices are a little high but their portions are nice (I got a chicken parm sandwich). They also have a nice little selection of desserts like Copa Stracciatella. For breakfast, quite a different story- very affordable egg sandwiches, good size, super quick! Also their coffee is to die for: some of my favorite coffee in Hoboken, especially considering a lot of other good coffee spots don't have dinner/breakfast menus."
Ankeet Shah, 8 months ago, 1, 'My review is based only on the coffee and not the food. I ordered a coffee frappe with almond milk. It looked white...i.e. no coffee. For a $6 coffee, I think it deserved a bad review.'

purple carrot, 9 months ago, 4, 'Coffee is really good! [One of the best i had]\nThey have a bunch of authentic looking pasta, olive oil, worth a look.\nStaff was okay, seemed impatient to move along to their next costumer, when i was the only one in line \\O/'

Nick DeGeorge, 9 months ago, 5, 'One of my new favorite neighborhood spots. Luca and his crew could not be more kind. It’s now a weekend morning tradition - take the stroller, the kid and walk up to see Luca for his amazing cold brew and a Bomboli with Nutella. Bravo!'

Any meal you get here is going to be one of your favorites.\n\nI've had the pizza more times than I can count, gnocchi, and a few other sandwiches. Throughout the year they've been adding to the menu and its always been a great addition.\n\nThe staff is always kind and friendly as well! This place is also BYOB which is convenient. I highly recommend coming in if you have not tried it yet."

Margaret Eschmann, a year ago, 1, "The business has been there for a year but they have never updated the old name of the business which was Buona Pizza to Alessio.  When you order from Buona you lose your money and Alessio's just happily tells you that is the old business and does nothing to correct the issue online.   I will never order from them and will remain a loyal Giovannis customer.  Thanks for wasting my time and money Alessio's."

Still making my way through the menu as I am new to Alessio's, but I have yet to have something I didn't love.  Luca and the rest of the staff are incredibly friendly and the service is excellent. The outdoor seating area is very comfortable and relaxing.  My new favorite spot in Hoboken! - John"
