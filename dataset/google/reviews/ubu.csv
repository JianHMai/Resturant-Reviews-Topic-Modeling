Melanie Tam, 7 months ago, 3, "Typical Hoboken fushi but will somewhat satisfy the sushi craving if you are in a pinch. I ordered for pickup on a Monday evening and I got there a little early but didn't have to wait too long until my order was ready. I just had the Fivestar roll (tuna, salmon, yellow tail, white fish, crab, avocado, cucumber and spicy sweet sauce). It wasn't bad but it was a little bit too saucy for me. I think if I order again, I would probably just stick to the regular rolls, without all the sauces."
followJTusa JT USA, 8 months ago, 4, '(Hoboken.jan. 2021). Japanese and Korean cuisine: For starters, I had bowl of Seafood Soup of delicately cooked mussells, baby squid, and kelp. The quantity  served in a petite bowl was just right for an appetizer. I enjoyed sharing the Lobster roll on the "Specials" board also as appetizer. The Five Star roll that combines Tuna, yellow tail, salmon with two other sashimi-quality fishes is a nine-piece large roll - done inside-out and topped with two house-blended sauces. (I would have preferred a sprinkling of sesame seeds or Tobiko along with the sauces. But it was very satisfying nevertheless). I also shared a combination 3-roll Maki which, surprisingly,  were not at all the large,\nrice-laden offering one expects but rather delicately prepared thinner rolls so typically Japanese in approach. (Thank you for helping me stick to my carb-restraint diet :-) ) All tasted fresh with no fish aftertaste. Ubu has continuously been in business for 23 years in this locationand kept its loyal clients. Expect an  Authentically Asian atmosphere, that also features Korean favorite. Nice and intimate when not busy; safely partitioned dining sections. Call for update on table availability for a large group.'

Mounika Reddy, a year ago, 5, 'Amazing ramen!!!'
Xauen Zirpolo, a year ago, 1, "Ordered delivery on a Friday night. Food took nearly 2.5 hours to arrive from a place only a few blocks away. I understand the spike in demand lately, so normally that'd be excusable. However, the sushi I ordered was absolutely bottom-tier in quality; the fish tasted old, the rolls barely held together, and the overall flavor was poor. The ramen was the same case, with barely any pork in it and totally lacking flavor. Prices aren't terrible, but still higher than other spots in Hoboken that serve better sushi more reliably so I can't even credit it that. I'd try your luck at a different place, there's no dearth of Japanese or Korean in Hoboken."

Shengxi Wu, 2 years ago, 2, "I came here only because of the overall high rating. The restaurant is quiet and nice, but the food is not impressive. I ordered a crab donburi at the restaurant, which costs $10.5 instead of $9.00 mentioned by Google. The food itself is just okay, i mean, JUST GENERIC. The taste is average or maybe below average (I am big fan of Japanese food and I've tried something better and cheaper before, maybe here is more expensive due to the restaurant's location). The avacado in it does not taste so fresh and I don't think it worth the money. Will not come back again for the donburi.\nPlus I also asked the staff for Wifi access and he told me there is no wifi in the restaurant. Not sure if that is the case."

Also, this is not a high end fancy place, you can meander over to Illuzion for that. Come to Ubu if you want something more down to earth.
