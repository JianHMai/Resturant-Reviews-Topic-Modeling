Veronica Glennon, 7 months ago, 4, "Good spot for beer & basic mixed drinks - they don't serve food so you can get food delivered or bring takeout with you. Definitely a spot that locals hang out and an older crowd compared to the bars on Washington St / close to the PATH. The regulars can be a little territorial especially at the pool table. Trivia on Wednesdays is always fun."
