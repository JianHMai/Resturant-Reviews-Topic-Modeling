Matthew Sheffield, 3 weeks ago, 5, 'Some of the best pizza I‚Äôve had in Hoboken! Super fresh ingredients, great flavorful crust with a nice char on the bottom. My new go-to spot! Good crispy fries too.'
Adam G., 2 months ago, 5, 'I\'ve tried multiple pizza places in Hoboken, including all of the "famous" places that are supposed to be so good. Each time I\'m disappointed compared to the great pizza at Uptown. My family all agrees that this is the best pizza in Hoboken. Favorites include the vodka pie (we get onions and pepperoni with it) and the standard pie (we love the portobello mushrooms, spinach and garlic with it). Food is good as well. I enjoyed the eggplant, eggplant sub and veggie stromboli. Stay away from the garlic bread.'

X Boone (The FiG), 6 months ago, 4, "Super Tasty, presentation a little gaudy, homely hole in the wall. I ordered a  chicken bacon and ranch Sicilian slice; 'twas fluffy, STACKEd, crunchy, and golden. Hefty, filling, and as visually pleasing as it tastes."

Katelyn Raspanti, 2 years ago, 2, 'We just ordered tonight to have it delivered to the Sheraton hotel down the street. Extremely disappointed after we had seen all the positive reviews. Our pizza toppings were incorrect, the pizza wasn‚Äôt hot, our garlic knots were like ROCKS, and we got a 2 liter of the wrong soda. It was all edible, but not enjoyable. I feel bad for those in Hoboken who think this place is worth it. Would not recommend.'

If you want a slice of pizza, this place is awesome.'

what is this .for real, 5 years ago, 4, 'I was drawn to this place by the delicious aroma emanating from the doors as I drove past. A bit pricey, like everything in Hoboken. But the sauce was delicious. I had a pepperoni slice which at first bite sent my taste buds to heaven but the bland crust soon creeper in and finishing he slice was a bit of a chore.  Again, their sauce is delicious, and I will go back for one of their true Italian dishes when I get time (parking is horrible). Will update review after my next visit. üòÄ'
