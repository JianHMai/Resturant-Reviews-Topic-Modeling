The Critical J, a year ago, 4, "PROS: This place was a nice social place to be on the weekend. We weren't able to get into many other places with a party of 7 but this place squeezed us right in. Nice drink menu, employees were very kind, music, lights, bouncers were enforcing CDC guidelines the best they could. Enough bathrooms to cater to the amount of people they have.\n\nCONS: This place brought in way more than the 25% capacity enforced by cdc and it felt like people were on top of each other. Also, the waitress overcharged one of our credit cards when we were splitting the bill and it was never reversed\n\nOVERALL: I will be going back to that place soon, just bring cash and don't be surprised if someone is breathing down your neck due to tight quarters"
