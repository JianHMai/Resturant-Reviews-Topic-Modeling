I'd already eaten breakfast there and walked to the counter. She'd suggested that I try a pastry. I said I was interested in the brötchen and stood in front of them, ready to purchase a couple of the pumpkin seed variety. Her friend sitting at a table said something to her in Spanish and all of a sudden she took the 4 pumpkin seed ones away and said they were for someone else. I could tell she felt weird saying it, but she did it anyway. I mumbled something about them being on display and available, but then just decided to be civil and not make a fuss.

My favorite is the Quark turnover. I grew up in Vienna so it, and the bread remind me of home.  I also like the hard boiled egg breakfast sandwich.\n\nPro tip: if there is something specific you want I suggest either coming early (especially on weekends) or call ahead and they’ll be happy to hold it for you. It’s baked fresh every day so while they try to make enough for demand, they do run out of items.\n\nI’m not a coffee drinker, but I hear it’s really good as well. My brother swears by it.'

The prices aren't bad at all.  Just get there early because the food here goes quickly and they only make a certain amount of each item.  I love this place and visit frequently.  If you happen to be in Hoboken stop by here you will not be disappointed. 5 stars for sure."

It was a great place to come in, order a dessert, and rest while eating a delicious sweet high calorie pleasure. They have great German chocolate cake which I can confirm. Very helpful staff in helping you choose what you might want to try for the first time.'

Melanie Tam, 4 years ago, 3, "I didn't get any sweets here but I did get this pastry filled with spinach, and this other pastry filled with eggplant and zucchini. The spinach one was a bit dry. I really enjoyed the eggplant and zucchini one because it also had some tomato sauce (?) in it, so it gave it a nice flavor. Judging from the rest of these reviews, I think I might be the only person who didn't go for the sweets.\n\nOverall, it's a bit pricey but it's good if you're in the area and you're looking for a savory snack that's somewhat healthy."

My wife and I spotted the bakery yesterday afternoon as we were about to return home from Hoboken and stopped for a cup of coffee and something sweet to go with it. It was a GREAT choice. We left with a loaf of Onion bread and 7 grain bread. Tried them both this morning. VERY happy we chose to buy the bread - they are delicious!  We are only unhappy that live so far away.'

Can only say if you like German bakery products this is the place to go! Keep it up over there, I'll be back!"

They always take their time making it and make it right in front of me and it comes out tasting absolutely perfect. It reminds me of the coffee I used to have in Europe. I have been living in Hoboken for 5 years, and they have the best coffee here, in my opinion. The owner always greets me, even if he is busy and asks how me and my husband are doing. Even if I am walking down the street, he always waves. Maggie, who works there, is super sweet and works so hard. I love all of their pastries too and they are a good size to split, as well. Everything has always tasted so fresh and it amazes me how many things they can make each day and how fast it all goes. I go to this bakery probably three times a week for coffee and it is such a special experience. This place is a gem!'

Ryszard Siembida (M&R Foto), 7 years ago, 5, "Happy 3 anniversary\nI have been coming here ALMOST everyday for about 3 years I am a very picky coffee drinker and VERY picky with my pastries, as well as customer service. I gave this 5 stars because I love the tranquility, EXCELLENT personal customer service, EXCELLENT coffee, I buy large everytime and have had pear chocolate,  quark balls, apple quark, raspberry/vanilla bar, almond/vanilla bar, mango cream cake...My advice is this: please do NOT come in here with a snobby, snap your finger attitude-go to Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks for that because there may be a wait. . Thank you so much for the owner's kindness/warmth and the staff's personable touch and again having kind souls! In such a fast paced, money hungry world, this place is worth my time and my hard earned money!"
Maria NS, 7 years ago, 5, "I went on a baked-goods-buying rampage yesterday.  It started at Carlo's Bakery.  I had never bought anything there and wanted to see if it lived up to the hype.  I didn't expect it to, and it doesn't.  However, on my way to buy coffee, I passed this little gem and couldn't help but buy something (more pastries!).  I would like to pass out flyers to all of those poor benighted fools standing in line at Carlo's, telling them they are at the wrong bakery.  The Old German Bakery was amazing, much better than anything you'll get at Carlo's.  At the Old German Bakery, you won't have to stand in line for two hours and your pastry will actually be fresh and made out of good quality ingredients....all for a better price tag.  It is a win, win, win, win.  Even better, this bakery is German-owned, and I suspect the pastries may actually be authentically German.  I don't know enough about the subject matter to say for certain, but the product is convincing.  Don't worry. You can still take your picture in front of Carlo's.  I won't tell anyone you didn't buy anything there."
