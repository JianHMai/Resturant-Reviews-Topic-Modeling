Ryan Joyce, 3 months ago, 1, 'This Dunkin‚Äô used to be great, now it‚Äôs absolute TRASH. I‚Äôve lived across from it for 3+ years, and went there almost daily. The old owner was fantastic and had the place running like clockwork. It sold to a new owner post-pandemic, and the place is an absolute joke now. Do you enjoy waiting 30+ minutes for your PRE-ORDERED mobile order? They don‚Äôt answer the phone if you need to change something. There‚Äôs no guarantee even going inside will get the employees to look at you. There even used to be a # to contact the owner inside and that‚Äôs gone. This place is terrible now, don‚Äôt go.'
Glaze, 3 months ago, 1, "The worst Dunkin on earth. They are constantly messing up orders, taking forever, talking back to customers, and I'm not sure how they ever pass a health inspection - the place is gross and the staff are leaning on garbage cans when making your food. Crustiest Dunkin ever. Stay away."
Diana Rodriguez, 4 months ago, 1, 'Omg if you‚Äôre planning on coming to this dunking pre order 30 min before because you will sit there forever and if they mess up your food they look at you like it‚Äôs your fault literally my 4th time coming here and it‚Äôs been the same since they put this Dunkin‚Äô here'
Kristen Irwin, 4 months ago, 1, 'I have been going to this Dunkin‚Äô Donuts for years now. The previous owner and staff was absolutely amazing, extremely friendly and efficient. The new staff is terrible. I‚Äôve waited over an hour for a mobile order. It has been months like this.'

X Mokoena, 6 months ago, 1, "I have been going to this Dunkin Donuts for 3 years (ever since we moved to Hoboken) and I have continued to be their regular customer despite the new management's rude, impolite and confrontational approach.  But enough is enough !!! They diluted the coffee to unbearable levels, my 'bacon, egg and cheese' sandwich had no bacon and I ordered iced water and was charged $0.75... are you kidding me ?! Almost $1 for iced water !!!"

Y Rosa, 7 months ago, 1, "I've been coming to this Dunkin Donuts for more than 5 years. In those years, the past manager, Louie and his staff made EVERY single person that walked in welcomed. They were so FRIENDLY, PROACTIVE, and PROFESSIONAL. I truly miss them. The new management is the complete opposite, RUDE, SCATTERED, and INCOMPETENT."

Alison Flood, 9 months ago, 1, 'Employees never wear masks correctly and are rude when you ask them to fix them. Service takes forever because employees are often socializing with friends instead of taking care of customers. Today I asked an employee to fix her mask to cover her nose (who I have had to ask previously) and she told me ‚Äúno.‚Äù Extremely unprofessional and a health risk, will not he back.'
Willow Willow, 9 months ago, 4, "dunkin' is a very good place to buy donuts and drinks .\nWhat can I say? their donuts are amazing. I have tried all types and they are so tasty! is very meticulous and they make wide varieties. they make the best donuts you can ever try .\nthe staff are very friendly and respectful .\nyou can take your order online and they deliver it immediately .\nso I want to thank all the people working there ."

Jonathan Greenstein, 10 months ago, 1, "Slowest dunkin on earth.  Placed a mobile order and waited for 10 minutes in the store.  Was late for a meeting.  Completely defeats the purpose of having the app.  Your money should be refunded when you have to wait for mobile orders like this\n\nUPDATE. Same thing happened again except i waited 15 minutes. Then gave them the courtesy of telling them not to make it and im going to dispute with my credit card.\n\nEasily the worst run dunkin I've ever seen."
Mary-Kate Ertugrul, 10 months ago, 1, 'Literally used to be the best dunkin where there was speedy service and the workers knew your order ahead of time when they recognized you. With new ownership, it is a complete mess and a complete waste of time. A month in, we thought they would have gotten the hang of things but sadly not. Extremely delayed and orders come out wrong. Try another dunkin in town if you can.'
Jan B, 11 months ago, 1, 'Since the ownership changed recently (with replacing the nice team which was working there) service and quality dropped tremendously.'

Wilde Trinidad, 2 years ago, 1, "Worst Dunkin donuts ever!!!!! I'm getting my coffee and I have to wait because people are coming to get free water..
