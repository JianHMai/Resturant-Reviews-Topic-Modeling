Club Social Anxiety, 3 months ago, 5, 'Absolutely love Belo Bar. Their food is delicious and their menu has a lot of variety for both food and drinks, all my friends were able to find food they‚Äôd enjoy which made our night unforgettable. The pasta is also unforgettable, and be sure to try ‚ÄúBest I Ever Had‚Äù. It is, in fact, the best drink you‚Äôll ever have!! Can‚Äôt wait to come back.'
Sofia Villamonte, 3 months ago, 5, 'The cutest place ever! The whole staff is very personable and has a very special way of making everyone feel very welcome. Great vibe.\nCocktails are also unique and well thought out! Highly recommend :)'
Geraldine Salazar, 3 months ago, 5, 'I love love love Belo Bar. Food is incredible! They have a great selection for both food and drinks, a little something for everybody. They have the best  espresso martini I‚Äôve ever had! Will definitely be returning!!'
Cindy Villamil, 3 months ago, 5, 'Love this spot. Such a nice change of vibe from the Washington Street bars. Tried a few different drinks with a friend and we loved them all. Even let the bartender Jessica convince me to try a bourbon drink because I don‚Äôt usually like bourbon and I‚Äôm glad I let her! Def recommend'
Victoria Mollinedo, 3 months ago, 5, 'Recently visited on a Saturday night. The bartender (Jessica) was both quick and very friendly suggesting specific cocktails which we both thoroughly enjoyed. I ordered the salmon farfalle pasta but with shrimp as a substitute to the salmon. It was delicious! I finished the entire dish and made my way over to my boyfriend ‚Äúbelo burger‚Äù. I don‚Äôt usually have high hopes for burgers at bars but this one was fantastic as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food considering it‚Äôs a cocktail bar. Looking forward to visiting again soon.'
Nicole Ramirez, 3 months ago, 5, 'My go-to place for unique and delicious cocktails.The owners are always very welcoming and the staff is wonderful. My server Camila was so sweet and made excellent recommendations. The burrata was out of this world and the penne pasta was the perfect amount of spice and flavor.'

Anika Saraf, 3 months ago, 1, 'Owner cussed us out with young kids at the table!!!\n\nWe finished our mediocre dinner and the kids were still hungry. When we went to order more food, the kitchen had closed so they got pizza from a nearby place and finished it our table. When the owner came he got extremely upset and took their pizza, threatening to throw it away. We understand eating outside food at a restaurant is wrong but the kids offered to eat it elsewhere. Unfortunately, the owner continued to curse and angrily yell. This was totally uncalled for and I don‚Äôt wish this horrible experience upon anybody. We will NEVER be back.'
Avi Animations, 3 months ago, 1, 'Manager cursed at kids. I was witnessing some horrible behavior of the owner. There was a family eating food at one of the tables. The owner was aggressively cursing with kids at the table. That is no way to treat customers no matter the circumstances. The customers weren‚Äôt causing a scene, breaking anything or being loud or annoying. Yet the owner still verbally attacked the customers.'

Charlene Javier, 4 months ago, 5, 'Wow is not the best of statements I can‚Äôt say for this establishment. I love a good cocktail bar with a great menu and from the moment I walked in the hostess/waiter was very patient with deciding on my drink as well as my indecisive gf. She was not only knowledgeable but well versed on the most preferable liquor depending on your taste. I, my self have experience working in the restaurant industry so I know how difficult it can be sometimes but even in their busiest hour she was patient. I would come here time and time again !

Had to leave a review warning people of the Artichoke dip, it was super hot even though the dish was cold, and even after a few days later top of my mouth is still burned. To be honest I have a strong suspicion that it was microwaved because something that hot would usually be bubbling if had come from an oven'

Sylvia Kloskowski, 5 months ago, 1, 'Honestly worst service I had in awhile. Took a hour and a half to get our food to us and drinks weren‚Äôt quick either. Won‚Äôt be returning. One person asked for Mayo for his burger and it arrived once he finished it. He waited 10 mins before he started to eat the cold burger he received.'

Des KF, 7 months ago, 3, "I had to pick a spot last minute for one of my girlfriends and I to get dinner. I called in and they were able to book me for a 7:30pm reservation. When we arrived I found parking nearby on the street. The place is small but they were able to keep it socially distant with indoor and outdoor seating. We were greeted by Z and he was doing the hosting and waiter. He was really nice but he wasn't very present. For drinks I ordered a glass of wine and my friend ordered a strawberry martini. The drinks took a long time before we got them.\n\nIt was now time to order our entr√©es and I ordered the linguini and meatballs and my friend ordered a shrimp salad and shrimp pasta. I tasted the shrimp salad and it was delicious. My entr√©e was just ok tasting and so was my friend's. It could of been seasoned a little more. We wanted to order more drinks and I had to search for Z several times. Another server Ray came over and saved the day. We ordered more drinks and of course it still took forever but Ray was on it. We asked for the bill and it came to a little over $100. All in all we had just an ok experience."

I‚Äôm patient but not that patient for a wait like that.\nMy uncle waited 45 min for his 6oz salmon. Lol..\nWater glasses were filthy..\nFood wasn‚Äôt great but the potato‚Äôs were fire!\nI‚Äôd only get the potato‚Äôs from here.\nWouldn‚Äôt really recommend the food.\nBut recommend the liquor of course'

Jacqueline G, 7 months ago, 1, 'Waited outside for over 35 mins with my fianc√©e in the cold to be told I‚Äôm sorry we have no room but the rude bouncer but they had literally had  no one inside!  Once we actually got in there their specialty drinks were way over priced and they were so incredibly watered down!! I‚Äôm from Boston but is this normal for Jersey ! Def not coming back !'
Bailey Mariner, 7 months ago, 3, '5stars down to 3stars\n\nI always walk by and was finally drawn in by the $1.50 oysters. I came here on a Saturday night with my SO and really enjoyed Belo Bar! No wait, very nice staff and good drinks! They do the oyster deal throughout the restaurant, not the bar only, which is nice. We also had the meatballs which were good but nothing special. Great atmosphere for date night. You can hear the conversation you‚Äôre having, nice low lighting, semi industrial decor, did I mention the drinks were solid?\n\nEdit 1yr later (covid): We still frequent Belo bar but in recent weeks the service has gone really down. I don‚Äôt usually review if a place is below 4 stars bc it‚Äôs easy for me, hard for business. But last nights reservation I felt unwanted? Everything was super slow, we finished our apps before we got our drinks and dinner took almost an hr to arrive. We asked for the heater next to us to be put on twice... just felt very ignored. But I will say drinks are always spot on!'
Amee Jogi, 7 months ago, 5, 'Great food! Great drinks!'
Christabelle Liu, 8 months ago, 3, 'The Nunya Business cocktail I had was incredibly one note - very sour and not much else. It had a lavender foam which was cool, but the drink itself was really odd tasting and I didn\'t get any hibiscus at all - it was really just lemon juice, some gin, and the ghost of lavender\'s past. My dinner partner got the Social Dilemma and said it was fine, nothing special or noteworthy about it.\n\nThe Trio Tartare (salmon, tuna, guacamole) appetizer was good, though! Credit where credit is due. Well flavored, though I don\'t know if I\'d necessarily count guacamole as a tartare (lol)...my recommendation would be bump up the price 2-4 dollars, add an actual 3rd tartare and serve the guacamole on the side as a surprise "for any extra bread/chips you may have!!!" kind of thing. That way you\'re filling the \'trio tartare\' title, and people are getting a bit of what they perceive as \'extra\' (the guacamole), which will make them super happy.\n\nWill come back here a next time to give it another try (maybe it was an off night!) and if the food and drinks necessitate it, I will update my review!'
Cara S, 8 months ago, 4, "Beautiful place with great food, drinks and atmosphere. Unfortunately the waiter we had truly marred the experience my friend and I had while there. Our waiter not only seemed to have an attitude for no reason but appeared to go out of his way to ignore our table and was observed several times hanging out by and being attentive to the other tables. Not once did he check on us or how we were doing, but instead the only other time he came by was to try and drop off the check, without even asking if we wanted anything else to eat or drink.  That being said the manager was more than courteous and helpful,  the caccio e pepe I ordered was delicious and both the drink and food menus offered a nice selection.   I'd love to come back but would hope that I get a different waiter."

One of the busboy Got so mad and threatened me to call security and police  because I told him he was not treating the other customer the same way than he was treating us. One of my friend went to bathroom and saw the girls inside finishing their alcohol (wine) in the bar. He said he has my information because my friend paid the bill With his card. He said maybe I was with a gun and I showed him I was clean. I had nothing on me, I just didn‚Äôt like the way they treated us. We paid over $100 bill and we had a different treatment and we don‚Äôt know why. He said he would treat anyone the way he wants. We do not recommend this place.'
