David Moss, 3 years ago, 4, 'It was loud, but the happy hour prices were nice. I was concerned that I was going to have a problem with the bartender since I only had one beer, at the happy hour price, and yet the sign said that a minimum of $10 was required to use a ‚Ä¶'

I wonder how many drunk people they get away with overcharging.'
