I was told by the lady behind the counter “I thought you are just here to see how bubble teas made since you don’t look Chinese or Asian”. Fact check - India is part of Asia and I found it to be super rude. Would never go there again.'

Logan Minami, 4 months ago, 5, 'I Came here on a whim before dinner after just seeing it on maps. Best bubble tea I’ve ever had.   I’m no tea connoisseur but I’ve spent 2 years working in a bubble tea shop and I’m from an area where bubble tea is very mainstream at every corner so I’ve had a good taste of many different kinds.\nThe tea itself was extremely “rich” and tongue tingling, and the flavor I got was a very nice combo of strawberry lemon green tea.  Not to mention the grape popping bubbles was something I have never heard of but was very impressed by.  Would 100% recommend to anyone in the are or walking the streets.  Definitely will make that a must stop for now on whenever I’m up north!'

I’ve been a customer for years always place pick up orders without a problem, even if they’re about to close soon I always get accommodated. Today I called at 9:40 to place my regular order that I get weekly and after the phone wasn’t answered multiple times knowing they’re open, the girl answered but is hesitating to take my order saying we close at 10 are you gonna be here before then ? Like obviously that’s why I’m calling. After I drive all the way from jersey city and inconvenience myself, I go inside to pick up my order that was placed 20 minutes ago and she tells me sorry I forgot. I’m like okay no problem, I give her the order again and she tells me that they just dumped the bubbles. Honestly so irritating because I don’t want bubble tea without bubbles and I just drove there for no reason when I called. Get more reliable workers.'

It's extremely customizable - you get to choose bubbles vs. tapioca, etc., flavor, sugar level, and ice level. Just be careful thought because those add-ins can add up real quick. I had the iced oolong tea with herbal jelly. I really enjoyed it but lots of the herbal jelly chunks were way to big to fit through the straw. The tea was great too. It wasn't watered down like I was half expecting. Would definitely be willing to come back and try some other combinations."
